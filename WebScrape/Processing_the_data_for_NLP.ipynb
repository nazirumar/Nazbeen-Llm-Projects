In 2022, more than 50% of VC deployed globally was invested in startups outside the U.S., according to data available from the National Science Foundation (NSF) — a stark contrast to 20 years ago, when nearly 80% of the world’s venture capital went into U.S. companies. Countries like China, India, Israel and the U.K. have led the charge in this shift, but smaller ecosystems across Europe, Latin America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa are also paying a part. Today, some 26% of the world’s unicorns are in these markets, according to a report by Endeavor Global, the organization that works with founders to build companies around the world with economic or social impact. Endeavor has worked with more than 1,500 companies across 40+ countries to date.Endeavor Catalyst, Endeavor Global’s co-investment fund, is home to over 50 such unicorns (having invested in over 300 companies across 30 countries). Some include Spanish talent marketplace Jobandtalent; Mexican digital freight forwarder Kavak; Indonesian aquaculture startup eFishery; Nigerian fintech Flutterwave; UAE buy now, pay later startup Tabby; and Turkish gaming company Peak Games.Investments largely from the U.S. have turbocharged the minting of unicorns in these markets during the hype years of 2020/2021. However, global venture capital investment activity has since slowed down, with a 38% decline year-over-year, resulting in fewer unicorns, a slower dealmaking process, and a retreat of global investors from emerging ecosystems.This retreat and the reset in valuations over the last couple of years have unsettled a few stakeholders across these ecosystems. Not only are there not enough local investors to write large checks, but also most are starting to approach deals timidly and are sometimes self-serving, according to Endeavor CEO Linda Rottenberg. For instance, in 2023, the African ecosystem saw a massive retreat from investors with a 50% decrease in unique participating investors, per a Partech report. In a recent conversation with TechCrunch, Rottenberg discussed how local investors can step up their game, why patient and long-term capital needs to be prioritized in emerging ecosystems, and the role of Endeavor and its co-investment arm in between.This conversation was edited for length and clarity.Venture capital has become a global industry, evident in Endeavor’s 300+ investments, mostly outside the U.S., where one in six companies in your portfolio is a unicorn. How has Endeavor managed to achieve this? So I think the fact is that we are entrepreneur-first. We like to support them, and even if not all investments work out with some of our founders, we see the next generation of C-suite go on to found the next companies and ecosystems. That’s the secret of Silicon Valley. I was with the CEO of a defunct African company, and he told me how 10 people had gone on to start their own [startups]. I asked another CEO who had just left his position, and he told me about how 30 people had done the same. This is what seeds ecosystems. Also, we don’t get scared. Whether the naira or real devalues, we’re on the entrepreneur side. We have 600 people on the ground and mix this capacity with pattern recognition and a global understanding. That’s why we have 58 unicorns and 24 exits. Our last fund was $300 million. We’re raising fund V next year, which we’ll cap as we still want to invest $2 million to $3 million in our startups. We get into 96% of the deals in our network as entrepreneurs, investors and ecosystems trust us because we take a long-term view. So I think that’s number one. How does the co-investment process work with the global community? Once you’re an Endeavor entrepreneur and pass through that selection process where you have to be unanimously selected by venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, or people who’ve scaled companies like Amazon and Netflix, you become an Endeavor entrepreneur. So you’re part of that peer-to-peer network. We help you expand internationally into some markets and with any sort of business challenges you have. But also, if you raise around $5 million or more — we’ve invested in $5 million rounds and $200 million rounds — from a qualified institutional lead, Endeavor Catalyst will come in at 10% of the round, capped at about $2 million. Finding enough qualified institutional investors for Series A, B and C is one of our biggest challenges in Africa. So, part of what we’re trying to do is seed the local ecosystem. There are some really strong seed-stage investors now, and we have to walk them up so that we have backers in the growth stages. We’re also trying to encourage global investors, whether from the U.S., London, Singapore, Dubai or Saudi Arabia, to look at founders in Nigeria, for example, so that we have a list of qualified leads that Endeavor Catalyst can follow. So it’s sort of that mix. So what I say is we’re patient, we’re trying to build the ecosystem locally, and we can also attract people globally who may be more nervous about emerging markets. How are your efforts going to build ecosystems locally and attract global investors?We were there early in Brazil and Indonesia. We can say the same for Saudi Arabia, Spain and some of these other markets like Greece. Right now, of all the 40 markets we’re in, the ones we’re most excited about in the next 5- to 10-year periods are Nigeria, Egypt and Vietnam. This is where it’s next. We’re trying to convince global investors who feel like they missed out on Brazil and Indonesia that these markets are next. We think these are big and important markets with impressive size, scale and talent.So, what we’re trying to do is get investors to feel the FOMO rather than wait until there are big exits from these countries, which will take the next three to five years. That’s why we want to work with the local investors to get stronger and more entrepreneur-friendly terms, which has not been the case recently in African markets. I think investors here have not been through down cycles, and therefore, we’ve seen the terms are much harsher in terms of liquidation preferences. Everybody’s recapping companies across the world. Investors in other markets are doing it where the entrepreneurs and teams still have incentives to grow. But here, it looks like investors are doing it so that they grab whatever they want, which is not a good strategy for the long term because then they’re dooming the company.There’s also the fact that in Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, local capital has developed over time, with local founders becoming funders — from Careem and Checkout.com to Mercado Libre and Loft. So you’re seeing founders becoming full-time funders. So I feel like we’re seeing some maturation around the world, but Africa is still really nascent.While I agree it’s not on the scale of other markets, I’d say there are a handful of African founders who are now part-time and full-time funders. But talking about global investors, you’ve mentioned how Endeavor is striving to make them return. How has their retreat affected Endeavor’s deal-making process?So that’s why it’s great that we have the hybrid model, right? We have the fund with $500 million in assets, and we have to have qualified institutional investors follow along to invest. We’ve made five investments in Nigerian companies. We hope to double that in the next couple of years, which would be great. But at Endeavor, within the nonprofit ecosystem we’re building, we’re there no matter what. So the answer is that the fund can only invest when we have qualified investments. So we’re doing our darndest to try to convince investors that the talent is there and that now is a good time, with good prices, and they’re moving more toward profitability. The Brazilian market is coming back. And by the way, Brazil has about eight companies lined up to IPO after Nubank. Nubank is a 10-year story and Brazil had already been 10 years in the making. So really, in Nigeria and Egypt, it’s going to happen. On the other hand, we’re doubling down and helping entrepreneurs, we’re helping them explore options: getting to profitability, raising debt, and figuring out an equity solution if necessary. As I said, I would be happier if we had more Series A-C investors with whom we could have conversations about how to restructure deals. We’re doing that in Latin America and, to some degree, in the Middle East. It’s been more challenging here, so we’re very excited about these new seed, Series A investors, but it’s going to take them two to three funds before they start moving up the market. Could the problem also be that there is a lack of viable growth-stage startups in Africa? Right now, some growth-stage funds focused on the continent are coming in quite early.I think Tiger and SoftBank didn’t do anyone favors with the [very high] 2021 valuations. So we’ve seen around the world people recapping, which is normal and OK as long as you do it in a way that you have some incentive for the founders in the next stage. I think growth-stage startups are prepared to take haircuts in valuation, but it needs to make sense.During the good times, U.S. investors will come in, but they will always pull out. There will always be the tourist capital, so enjoy the ride when they’re there. But emerging ecosystems have to have a strong local investor base, particularly at the growth stage, so that when tourists pull out, investments can still happen. What do you think local investors in Africa could learn from their counterparts in Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East?They should learn that now is the best time to invest. It’s back to Warren Buffett: “Be fearful whenever others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” Everyone’s fearful now, basically, so it’s the best time. Believe in the talent, believe in the market, especially in Nigeria, and realize an extended time horizon. It takes 10 years to grow American companies; it’s going to take 10 to 15 years in emerging markets. We have a company in Mexico, Clip, looking to go public about 15 years after its founding, and people are so excited about that happening in Mexico. It takes time. And then once that happens, what we’ve seen in places like Brazil, Indonesia, and big markets, it kicks off. Invest now so you don’t have FOMO later. Go to the As and Bs; there’s still money to be made. And VCs at larger funds should not be doing a lot of seed investing; you’ve got to be putting the money to work. That’s what I think.Flipping it, what could founders in Africa learn from other emerging markets?They should learn that it’s always harder for the pioneers. The first generation is always the hardest, and they should feel proud of what they’re doing — even if not every business right now works out because the capital is not there or because they’re early in the market. All the ideas we’re backing are seeding the ecosystem; we’re building this multiplier effect. And I think investors need to give founders some grace and give each other a break.       More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsAfrica, Asia, Endeavor, Endeavor Catalyst, Endeavor Global, Mexico, Middle East, South America, Startups, Venture \t\tApps\tX is getting closer to launching its payment serviceLauren Forristal\t1 hour agoX (formerly Twitter) appears to be making progress on its upcoming payments system, bringing it closer to Elon Musk’s vision of turning X into an “everything app.”   According to a… \t\tSpace\tDawn Aerospace’s rocket-propelled aircraft takes flightAria Alamalhodaei\t1 hour agoDawn Aerospace’s rocket-powered aircraft soared to new heights in its latest test campaign, as the company looks to build what could be the highest-performance aircraft to take off from a… \t\tHardware\tMade by Google 2024: Pixel 9, Gemini, a new foldable and other things to expect from the eventBrian Heater\t1 hour agoGoogle unveiled the Nest Learning Thermostat 4 and Google TV Streamer.

But the serial entrepreneur was getting antsy. He had already founded and sold two startups, including Insent, which ZoomInfo bought in 2021. “Once you start a startup, you always have that bug,” he told TechCrunch. Soon after ChatGPT came out, he was ready to launch his own company for the third time. Given that he spent more than a decade running startups or working in sales tech, he was sure that generative AI could help make technical sales faster and more effective. “I couldn’t wait. I had to get out and start the company.”In August 2023, Pillai left ZoomInfo and launched DocketAI, a virtual sales engineer. On Thursday, the company announced that it raised a $15 million Series A led by Mayfield and Foundation Capital.While working at ZoomInfo, Pillai noticed that sales engineers, who are technical sales experts, were getting pulled into various conversations with prospective buyers — including some that didn’t require their expertise. A lot of account executives ask them complicated but rather routine questions. “Bringing a sales engineer to every call is expensive, super inefficient, and takes a lot of time,” Pillai said.So Pillai saw an opportunity to build an AI version of sales engineer. DocketAI helps non-technical salespeople obtain fast answers to technical questions and receive assistance with drafting requests for proposals (RFPs) and other technical documents.DocketAI doesn’t replace sales engineers but frees up their time to work “on more interesting, complex and strategic enterprise deals,” Pillai said.Image Credits: DocketAIThe startup’s AI works by integrating, ingesting and indexing data from over 100 applications used by Docket’s software clients. Pillai emphasized that the company doesn’t train its AI on enterprise data. Docket, just like Glean and Atlassian’s Rovo, acts as a search engine for structured and unstructured workplace data.But Docket’s AI is different in that it also learns from the actions of top salespeople, Pillai said.“It’s not just about giving the facts to a buyer,” Pillai said. “Docket learns from top sellers, and it has the ability to scale best practices across the company.”Pillai claims that sales organizations that use Docket increase productivity and win rates.The company has been actively selling its product since earlier this year and is currently adding several new enterprise-level paying customers a month.“Our smallest customer has 15 seats, and our biggest customers have 10,00 seats,” Pillai said, who added that he counts ZoomInfo and Demandbase among that list.

Sacks was an investor in Zenefits who joined as COO. Conrad was ousted from Zenefits after allegations arose around improper employee licensing and Sacks took over as CEO. (Sacks left Zenefits not long after that. In 2022, the company sold to TriNet.)Conrad apparently never forgave Sacks for not issuing a friendly founder-leaving announcement. The press release at the time blamed Conrad for governance issues. Conrad went on to launch another HR tech company that he leads as CEO, Rippling, and has grown it to a $13.5 billion valuation.Sacks replied to Conrad on X: “You were sanctioned by the SEC. Nobody else, only you. But you’ve spent the last decade trying to shift the blame onto others for your own poor ethics.” It should be noted that Conrad and Zenefits settled an SEC investigation and paid fines without admitting fault. But no matter, almost immediately after Sacks posted his reply, swords were drawn all over Silicon Valley. Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham entered the conversation, writing: “Do you really want the full story of what you did to Parker to be told publicly? Because it’s the worst case of an investor maltreating a founder that I’ve ever heard, and I’ve heard practically all of them.” In another post he called Sacks, “evil.”Sacks wrote a lengthy, scathing reply saying that the two had never met, pointing to the SEC investigation, and accusing Graham of some underhanded behavior toward Jewish VCs, although Sacks (who is Jewish) did not supply evidence to support such allegations.Then Cloudflare cofounder Matthew Prince weighed in, siding with Conrad against Sacks, who he says he knew in college. “I know this story. It’s very bad. Don’t know if David is most evil person in SV. Lots of competition.”Other VCs pointed out that founders should know who they are allowing into their companies. “VC Twitter this week has been like a walking advertisement for self funding, lol. Lots of people out there you don’t ever want to be in the same room with, let alone on your cap table. Maybe the best differentiator is just being a decent human!” Climate VC Jason Jacobs, founder of MCJ Collective wrote.Eric Bahn of HustleFund replied to Jacobs: “VC has a serious brand problem. All the bickering, finger pointing, name calling, ad hominem attacks within the industry are being noticed by founders. There are good VC humans on this side of the table, but this clowniness makes us all look bad.”Certainly, it’s not the look that VCs usually try to present. Typically, Silicon Valley VCs bend over backwards to present themselves as “founder friendly.” They have to if they want to entice the best entrepreneurs to work with them. Venture investors buy ownership stakes complete with voting rights, sometimes board positions, and often do so under the premise that they won’t use that power to oust founders from their own companies. Of course, boards that include VCs still can and do oust founders, which many founders fear. (That’s why Peter Thiel named his firm Founders Fund, because one of its tenets is never to vote against founders.)Indeed, this public back-and-forth would have been shocking in an earlier day and age. But now some of Silicon Valley’s most successful founders and investors routinely take the gloves off. The latest blowup follows one over the weekend between Democrat supporter VC Vinod Khosla and Trump supporter Elon Musk arguing over their political choices with words like “depravity” being tossed out. And it follows one in March between Khosla and VC Marc Andreessen over AI regulation that got into “patriotism” territory.Maybe public spectacle is what they want. While duking it out with Sacks, Graham, husband to VC Jessica Livingston, managed to sneak in a plug for her podcast Social Radar. And the Graham/Sacks fight culminated with Sacks’ friend Chamath Palihapitiya wading in, not to so much voice support, but to plug the famous podcast the two do with fellow VC Jason Calacanis, All-In. Palihapitiya posted on X, “There is so much to say about this. We will document and talk about all of it this week on @theallinpod. PS – with receipts (even deleted ones!).”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsdavid sacks, Eric Bahn, parker conrad, Paul Graham, Rippling, Startups, Venture, vinod koshla \t\tAI\tApple Intelligence’s writing tools stumble on swears and controversial topicsIvan Mehta\t19 mins agoApple’s Writing Tools feature will show a message notifying you that AI-generated suggestions might not be of the highest quality when tackling certain topics. \t\tApps\tFlighty’s popular flight-tracking app can now predict delays using machine learningAisha Malik\t19 mins agoPopular flight tracking app Flighty is releasing a new version on Tuesday that uses machine learning and aviation authority data to provide early warnings of delays and give users the… \t\tHardware\tChromecast is dead.

The phrase refers to Big Tech starting to slash some of the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs that were implemented shortly after the murder of George Floyd. Most recently, Zoom announced that it laid off its DEI team. Google and Meta have started to defund their DEI programs, and funding to Black founders continues to dip. Lawsuits have been filed targeting DEI programs, forcing companies to now hide their inclusion efforts while billionaires are arguing on X about whether DEI initiatives are discriminatory or not.It’s clear that this year will be a turning point for DEI, especially as states continue to ban affirmative action measures and with a presidential election just around the corner. Here are all the stories you need to read to stay updated on the developments regarding tech’s ongoing DEI backlash.This list will be updated, so keep checking back.Read about the AAER vs. Fearless Fund lawsuitIn August 2023, the American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER), founded by Edward Blum, the man who helped overturn affirmative action in education, filed a lawsuit against the venture fund Fearless Fund for offering business grants to Black women. The AAER alleged that the grant discriminates against white and Asian American founders. The Fund and AAER are battling the case in court, and currently, Fearless Fund is barred from awarding grants to any more Black women.On Instagram, Arian Simone, the CEO of the Fund, said that the lawsuit has financially hurt the fund, as it lost millions in potential commitments and faced staff cuts, low cash run, expensive legal bills and threatening letters. The impact of the lawsuit, however, could go much deeper than just affecting one fund and could have ripple effects throughout the ecosystem.But Fearless Fund isn’t the only one being sued. The Small Business Administration, Minority Business Development Agency and even smaller companies like Hello Alice are being targeted and sued for trying to implement diverse grant schemes.Here’s what the Fearless Fund lawsuit could mean for ventureFearless Fund responds to racial discrimination lawsuitFearless Fund barred from awarding grant to Black women foundersAn appeals court rules that VC Fearless Fund cannot issue grants to Black women, but the fight continuesFearless Fund grant program was already ‘at risk’ before lawsuitThe civil rights movement comes to venture capitalInvestors suggest funds prepare for the fallout of the Fearless Fund lawsuit, not worry about itFearless Fund’s founder has resigned, and it’s a sad reflection on the VC world for Black women Contact Us\t\tDo you have a tip or story you would like to share about being a woman, person of color, or a marginalized individual working in venture capital or startups?

A lot of big names in venture, like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Y Combinator founder Paul Graham, have shared sentiments against DEI, while only a few, like Mark Cuban, have expressed support for it. This division is bound to last and only get deeper as billionaires continue wielding their power — and influence — to make their opinions heard.At the same time, there are many who are indeed trying to change and become more inclusive. Change takes time, though, and some of the promises made haven’t been fulfilled.Tech’s DEI backlash is here3 years after BLM, here’s who stuck to their diversity commitmentsSilicon Valley leaders are once again declaring ‘DEI’ bad and ‘meritocracy’ good — but they’re wrongRead how governments are handling DEICalifornia passed a bill last year that will soon require venture capital firms in the state to reveal the diversity breakdown of the founders they back. Some herald the bill as progress in a notoriously opaque industry.However, California is not the only state looking to address diversity. Massachusetts is looking to pass a bill that would extend workplace laws to the venture industry; New York City venture firms informally got together to create an alliance to back more diversity. There is excitement surrounding these initiatives, but also some hesitation.Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, who is co-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, has been trying to pass a bill in Congress that would make endowment investing more transparent. He’s hit a snag and said that a few educational institutions in the nation have been outright “nasty” toward him and his efforts.DEI has become a hotbed issue in red states, as many have taken to banning affirmative action measures. Many tech hubs are actually just blue cities, meaning more liberal-leaning cities, within red, or more conservative-leaning, states. These include Tulsa, Atlanta, Miami and Austin, and all are at the forefront of helping to make tech more accessible to people outside of the Bay Area. But will their governing states put a dagger in all that progress?Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, is a leader in passing anti-DEI measures. From book banning to speech restrictions, he is also one of a few governors taking aim at ESG investing, proposing a move that could affect diverse fund managers in the state of Florida.On a national level, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) has taken to finding out more about what is happening in tech. It recently wrote letters to OpenAI and the Department of Labor to see how the tech industry is looking to support Black talent during this time.OpenAI actually did respond to the CBC, and we got the scoop on what happened next.New California law would force firms to report diversity metricsInvestors are split on whether California’s diversity bill will make an impactProposed legislation would force US higher education endowments to reveal where they investTulsa’s tech scene remains resilient amid state’s anti-DEI effortsRon DeSantis’ proposed ban on ESG investments would be another blow for diverse fund managersBlack representatives in Congress voice concerns over impact of tech layoffs on minority workersOpenAI responds to Congressional Black Caucus about lack of diversity on its boardRead the latest DEI funding dataFunding to Black founders has continued to dip since 2020, and last year was no different.Funding to Black founders was down in 2023 for the third year in a rowRead the DEI view from abroadIndustries abroad look to the States, including when it comes to how marginalized founders are treated.

GovWell co-founder and CTO Ben Cohen discovered this while trying to help his dad, a contractor, apply for building permits. Cohen worked as a full stack engineer at Uber during the day and faxed documents for building permits at night. The difference in tech was stark. Years later, this experience inspired him to launch GovWell.New York-based GovWell is a workflow system for small and medium-sized governments that helps automate and streamline tasks ranging from building permits and code to zoning to fire safety inspections. GovWell co-founder and CEO Troy LeCaire told TechCrunch that the platform is helping local governments complete tasks in a fraction of the time it used to take.LeCaire added that every government runs these processes a little differently, so GovWell’s platform was designed in a way that allows governments to customize it to their requirements without having to pay for a bespoke platform.“It’s a single product that can be configured by no-code tools to make the software adapt perfectly to what it needs to do,” LeCaire said. “A good example is something like Salesforce — it can be configured to adapt to different businesses, but under the hood, it is the same process.”LeCaire and Cohen were matched through a founder speed-dating activity at Fractal Software, a New York-based startup incubator. They realized that they both had experience with government, Cohen’s with his dad and LeCaire’s with political campaigns and a college degree in the subject. They first set out to build a software that automated building permits but quickly realized the problem was larger than that.“We called hundreds of municipalities and asked them what [software] they were using and if they liked it, and we found that people didn’t like it despite paying thousands if not millions for it,” LeCaire said. “We realized that government needed a more general workflow solution.”GovWell landed five government customers before the founders had written a line of code. Now, since its launch in April 2023, GovWell works with more than a dozen local governments ranging from parks departments to health departments across seven states.The company raised a $4.5 million seed round led by Work-Bench with participation from existing investor Bienville Capital. LeCaire said that the company didn’t need to raise money and is on a path toward positive cash flow. They decided to raise because there was inbound investor interest and the company had the ability to set its own terms to accelerate growth. GovWell will use the money to triple the team in the next 18 months and invest in product development.GovWell isn’t the only company looking to bring government software into the 21st century. A handful of startups, like GovDash, Hazel and Odo, are also looking to bring better software to the government contract space. There are some that focus on government workflow too. OpenGov is one. It’s a digital cloud software provider for governments that raised $178 million in venture funding before being acquired by Cox Enterprises earlier this year. GovPilot is another.LeCaire said even with other software players, there isn’t competition in this sector like there is in AI or B2B SaaS.“The scale of the problem is enormous,” LeCaire said. “Government expenditures is 36% of GDP. Local governments spend $1.8 trillion administering services. It’s a huge sector of the economy. Their adoption of AI, it is a massive market that touches everyone’s lives, the education system, and economic and community development.”LeCaire said that while people don’t think of local governments as being big adopters of new tech — which isn’t entirely wrong — this area is different because these organizations are already spending quite a bit of money on it. GovWell hopes it can become that go-to provider.“Our goal is to become the number one workflow automation for smaller and medium-sized local governments over the next 18 months,” LeCaire said. “What we are doing here, it is a unifying idea that, hey, government should work better. We all pay taxes. We all want our government to be efficient and effective to use.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsArtificial Intelligence (AI), Governments, govtech, North America, startup, Startups, United States, Venture, venture capital \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46B in Q2 as it drives toward a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t2 hours agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost-efficient versions — a sign of… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t2 hours agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.That growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory. And its latest partnership with Apple for its upcoming generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, has given the company another significant bump in the AI race.2024 also saw the release of GPT-4o, OpenAI’s new flagship omni model for ChatGPT. GPT-4o is now the default free model, complete with voice and vision capabilities. But after demoing GPT-4o, OpenAI paused one of its voices, Sky, after allegations that it was mimicking Scarlett Johansson’s voice in “Her.”OpenAI is facing internal drama, including the sizable exit of co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever as the company dissolved its Superalignment team. OpenAI is also facing a lawsuit from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers, including the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune, for alleged copyright infringement, following a similar suit filed by The New York Times last year.Here’s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year.

This allows Leaf customers, who range from crop insurance providers to agtech startups, to better utilize and build off the data. Customers pay for the service based on how many acres their data is harvested from.Stockdale said he got the idea for the company in 2018 when the manager of his family’s farm told him that to decide which day would be best to plant seeds, he would go out at 6 a.m. to stick a thermometer into the ground. If it read 70 degrees, they would plant the seeds, if it didn’t, they wouldn’t. The anecdote stuck with Stockdale.“Agriculture, it is a funny industry; it is simultaneously extremely sophisticated and totally antiquated,” Stockdale said. “My family has had a farm in Illinois for over 100 years. In that time, a lot of things have changed but some things haven’t.”He said his first idea was to implement some technology to help the farm choose which crops to plant and when. He knew the farm had loads of data from their tractors and decided to start there, but the data he found, while plentiful, was incredibly difficult to decipher. He was curious how other tech companies were able to make any use of it.“I just started calling people and asking them, ‘How do you do this?’ And no one had a good answer,” Stockdale said. “I said, ‘OK, maybe it is time to go find something else to do.’ There is no way anyone can break into this infrastructure; maybe it would be interesting to solve this. If I build this infrastructure layer so they can build these other use cases on top of it, there is a huge range of use cases that need this data.”So Stockdale pivoted and Leaf was launched. He said building the product was tedious, as they had to reverse engineer each data file type separately. Leaf started selling in mid-2021 and now works with more than 80 companies, including agriculture giants like Bayer and Syngenta.The startup just raised a $11.3 million Series A round. Stockdale said that despite the company’s traction, it took a few months of pitching to find investor interest because not many people understood just how bad the farm data problem was. But after four months, Leaf found its people. The round was led by Spero Ventures with participation for existing investors, including S2G Ventures, Radicle Growth and SP Ventures, among others.Stockdale said Leaf is going to put the money toward building out a commercial go-to-market team. He added that he’s been on all of the sales calls for the last six months and that just isn’t sustainable anymore. Leaf will also use the capital to continue improving the product to better respond to new use cases from their customers.One area is improving the quality and accuracy of the data; some of Leaf’s customers are looking to use it as input for AI prediction models surrounding things like when to plant which crops and where or how much they should treat a field with certain fertilizers based on prior years’ data. Leaf also has customers looking to go end to end with their data on Leaf, removing a cloud provider like AWS, something that Stockdale said the company wants to offer.“Agriculture is a really interesting industry in itself because of the paradox of high sophistication and zero sophistication,” Stockdale said. “It’s great to get in with a lot of these customers and get started; now that we are rolling, we are kind of embedded. It’s a great industry and bringing something new to market is a little bit of a big bet. [Leaf is] an API in a fairly antiquated industry but it’s working.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsAgTech, AI, APIs, Climate, North America, Plaid, startup, Startups, United States, Venture, venture capital \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t10 mins agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

But the organizers say the effort isn’t meant to align with any one political party. According to the group’s website, signing on is a commitment to “strong, trustworthy institutions.”“We believe that strong, trustworthy institutions are a feature, not a bug, and that our industry — and every other industry — would collapse without them,” a statement on the VCsForKamala site reads. “That is what’s at stake in this election. Everything else, we can solve through constructive dialogue with political leaders and institutions willing to talk to us.”VCsForKamala, along with recent open-letter tech worker campaigns like Tech for Kamala, aim to push back against the notion that Silicon Valley has largely embraced ormer President Donald J. Trump.Over the past few weeks, Tesla and X head Elon Musk and investors Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and David Sacks have endorsed Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Musk created a new pro-Trump super PAC, and Sacks spoke at the Republican National Convention. The billionaire Winklevoss twins, founders of cryptocurrency company Gemini, also donated to Trump’s campaign (in bitcoin).Trump’s Silicon Valley base argues that the Republican party — and Trump himself — are generally more favorable to the startup ecosystem. Andreessen and Horowitz have said that they believe, for example, that President Joe Biden and his administration have stifled tech businesses through overregulation and potentially needless taxation, and that their policies threaten to slow gains in the AI and crypto spaces.Harris has held varying positions on tech regulation as California’s attorney general, in the U.S. Senate, and as VP. In 2019, as a state senator, she advocated for a breakup of Meta (then Facebook). And last year, she hosted four tech CEOs — Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai — at the White House “to share concerns about the risks associated with AI.”Harris has at different times in her career drawn praise and financial support from tech leaders such as Box CEO Aaron Levi, Marc Benioff, Sheryl Sandberg and Jony Ive. Hoffman, Laurene Powell Jobs and venture capitalist John Doerr are among those who backed Harris’ last presidential bid that ended in December 2019, when she dropped out of the race to endorse Biden.Harris and her allies, looking to muster support among Silicon Valley elite who haven’t cast their lot, have launched a blitz of behind-the-scene lobbying campaigns. According to The New York Times, Harris is planning a fundraising trip in the San Francisco Bay Area as soon as next month. This has proven to be a winning strategy so far. Per NBC, Harris is on track to raise over $100 million from tech donors, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, across her campaign, PACs and so-called “dark money” groups.

It went on to be part of more than 500 food and beverage builds and part of 93 companies that successfully exited. Melissa Facchina, co-founder and managing partner at Siddhi Capital.Image Credits: Siddhi Capital“We were basically ‘guns for hire,’ and would go into companies to solve scaling problems,” she said. “That got us a lot of attention with investors, and I started to realize what I thought was an unhealthy relationship forming between the investor and the investee.”Facchina would see investors making what she thought were impractical demands on companies, for example, asking them to do something that they couldn’t do in timeframes that they couldn’t do it in. Mainly because the company didn’t know how to scale a CPG business, she explained.When the desired outcomes didn’t materialize, the investor would ding the company’s valuation or want a change in management. What Facchina then saw were companies lying to their investors and boards because they were afraid of the outcome. She thought there might be a better way.Enter Siddhi Capital, an operationally focused growth equity firm investing in the food and beverage industry. The firm’s portfolio includes brands like Aura Bora sparkling water, Thistle food delivery, chocolate snack company Mid-Day Squares and cereal maker Magic Spoon.Facchina co-founded and shares a managing partner title with Steven Finn, who has led hundreds of investments through his family office. Together with a team of 24, the 4-year-old firm raised a nearly $70 million Fund I with the help of Finn’s father, Brian Finn, who is now Siddhi’s chairman. Previously, he was the former CEO of Credit Suisse USA.Being an emerging fund manager has not been a picnic over the past four years. And for women-led funds, it’s even more difficult: Women-led funds’ share of total fundraising increased to about 3% of the $107 billion raised last year by venture funds worldwide, according to Venture Capital Journal.Facchina didn’t have those challenges, though, because that first fund was closed in an hour. Yes, you read that right. She admits that much of that was due to Brian Finn’s influence and high-net-worth individual friends.“I can’t say them by name, but some of the most notable personal investors in the world have invested in us,” she said. “I could never have done that on my own. The proof is in the pudding that when you marry two really good sets of skills together, people pay attention.”Siddhi recently closed on a $135 million Fund II that didn’t take an hour to close. In fact, it took two years to close. However, roughly 98% of the limited partners reinvested in the second fund, Facchina said. Much of that was due to launching the fund just as the Ukraine war with Russia was happening. The firm “was very fortunate that our current investor group believed in what we were doing and was happy with the trajectory of Fund I,” though she didn’t think it would take two years.The firm did invest during that time, adding 10 companies into the fund, including lab-grown protein ingredient company Ingrediome and recombinant protein producer Future Fields.Siddhi Capital’s first fund went into 40 more early-stage companies, but Fund II will focus on deploying more money into fewer companies at a more growth equity stage. Facchina expects to invest $5 million to $10 million into companies making between $25 million and $100 million in revenue. A majority of the investments will go into consumer packaged goods companies and a small portion into food tech companies working in areas like fermentation and cellular agriculture.

Following those results, the company scores every food (on a scale from 0 to 100), so people can make better choices of what to eat. Zoe’s nutrition-tracking programs includes glucose monitoring. (Image credit: Zoe)Image Credits: Zoe / Along the way, Zoe teaches users how to swap, add, and combine foods so you can eat in the best way for your body. For example, it might advise a user to swap out toast with peanut butter, bananas, and sliced almonds for toast with cream cheese, avocado, and chia seeds. It also tracks their progress with continued gut microbiome testing.The new investment comes from the U.S.-based investment company Coefficient Capital and gives Zoe $118 million in total funding to date, including a £25 million ($30 million at the time) raise in 2022.The latest raise follows the completion of a randomized controlled trial published in Nature Medicine in May 2024. The trial looked at the effects of personalized nutrition on cardiometabolic health. This is among 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers Zoe has published over the past seven years and is meant to counter the perception that microbiome mapping is squishy science.Company CEO Jonathan Wolf explained that the trial is the same thing that is done for vaccines or drugs and is the “gold standard in medicine.” It’s a full trial where you compare the intervention — in this case, Zoe’s membership — against the control, or basic standard of care in the U.S. and dietary guidelines.What makes it interesting, other than finding out the results, is that the researchers are obliged to publish the outcome, no matter what it says.“As a CEO, it’s terrifying to go into this RCT because you are committed,” Wolf told TechCrunch. “If it proves that Zoe doesn’t work, you’ve got to publish it.” The research showed Zoe did work and “comprehensively outperformed the control,” he said. Results showed that using Zoe can improve biological markers after three to four months, and also made a positive impact on how people felt, something Wolf said he wasn’t expecting. For example, Zoe users reported improvements to mood, sleep, and energy.Losing weight has always been a trend but is particularly hot now with the rise of GLP-1 injectables like Ozempic and Wegovy, However, Wolf was clear that Zoe wasn’t going after weight loss. Instead, the company is focused on nutrition, and better nutrition often leads to weight loss.“Nutrition has been horrendously understudied because there’s been no money in it from pharmaceutical companies,” Wolf said. “Therefore, advice is often ‘eat more vegetables.’ And most of the advice that we have been taught has turned out to just be wrong. For example, if you need to lose weight, you should go on a calorie-controlled diet. All the latest nutritional science says that calorie-controlled diets do not work for 80% of people.”Wolf didn’t disclose financial numbers but did say that the company had virtually no revenue two years ago. Now its paid customer base has risen to more than 100,000. Most are purchasing a 12-month subscription, which costs $29 per month in the U.S., or $348 per year. The company’s products are available in the United States everywhere except New York, due to regulatory challenges that Wolf and his team are working through. The new funding will help the company increase its presence in the U.S.“We are going to start investing in marketing because there are millions of people we know we can help in the States,” Wolf said. “For the first time, the product is ready and mature enough for us to do that.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsCoefficient Capital, Fundraising, Jonathan Wolf, microbiome, nutrition, Startups, Venture, Zoe \t\tApps\tX is getting closer to launching its payment serviceLauren Forristal\t2 hours agoX (formerly Twitter) appears to be making progress on its upcoming payments system, bringing it closer to Elon Musk’s vision of turning X into an “everything app.”   According to a… \t\tSpace\tDawn Aerospace’s rocket-propelled aircraft takes flightAria Alamalhodaei\t2 hours agoDawn Aerospace’s rocket-powered aircraft soared to new heights in its latest test campaign, as the company looks to build what could be the highest-performance aircraft to take off from a… \t\tHardware\tMade by Google 2024: Pixel 9, Gemini, a new foldable and other things to expect from the eventBrian Heater\t2 hours agoGoogle unveiled the Nest Learning Thermostat 4 and Google TV Streamer.

The sources requested anonymity as the conversations were private. His departure adds to high-profile shifts within Tiger Global. Scott Shleifer, who previously led the firm’s private equity business, moved to a senior advisory role last year. John Curtius, who led the firm’s software investments, left in late 2022. Cook anchored many fintech deals for Tiger Global, including TradingView, TrueLayer, Scalapay, Xendit, Selfbook, Fazz and Refyne. The median size of his deals were about $35 million whereas the median valuation stood at north of $250 million, according to PitchBook. The departure has come as a surprise to at least some founders. Cook spoke frequently — multiple times a week — to founders, according to some accounts. He assumed responsibility for managing relationships with some portfolio startups previously overseen by Shleifer, according to people familiar with the matter.Tiger Global declined to comment. Cook’s focus extended significantly to emerging markets, particularly India, where he frequently visited and met with founders in person. In July 2022, for instance, he told founders in Bengaluru, India, that Tiger Global was about to slow its pace of investments, TechCrunch reported at the time.This development comes at a challenging time for the venture industry. Tiger Global raised $2.2 billion for its latest VC fund, its smallest fundraising effort in a decade and a stark contrast to its previous years of robust investor demand that had allowed the New York-based giant to raise increasingly larger funds, including its record $12.7 billion fund. At $2.2 billion, to be sure, Tiger Global is still operating one of the largest funds. Amid this difficult fundraising climate, fueled by investor caution towards VC and private equity investments due to declining returns, Tiger Global announced a significant leadership change in November, with founder Chase Coleman assuming the role of venture chief from Shleifer. Coleman has taken on the responsibility of managing relationships with certain key portfolio startups globally, according to people familiar with the matter.

On Tuesday, the SEC charged BitClout founder Nader Al-Naji with fraud and unregistered offering of securities, claiming he used a pseudonymous identity to avoid regulatory scrutiny while he raised over $257 million in cryptocurrency. BitClout, a decentralized social media platform, raised from a who’s-who of firms, like a16z, Sequoia, Chamath Palihapitiya’s Social Capital, Coinbase Ventures and Winklevoss Capital. Many of these big name investors were in at the company’s roughly $7 million seed round, with Sequoia investing $1 million and a16z investing $3 million, according to sources close to the seed round at the time. The SEC complaint alleges that Al-Naji, known by his online pseudonym “DiamondHands,” told investors that proceeds from the platform’s token, BTCLT, would not be used to pay himself or employees. But the SEC alleges that he spent over $7 million on personal expenses, like a Beverly Hills mansion and gifts for his family. Al-Naji did not respond to a request for comment. A source close to Al-Naji said the mansion was used for business purposes, with several BitClout employees living there and throwing company-sponsored events at the home.The complaint is the latest for a company that has been no stranger to controversy from the start. In 2021 when it was launched, BitClout was intended to be a social crypto-exchange where users bought and sold tokens based on people’s reputations. It made waves and earned criticism by scraping 15,000 profiles from the company then known as Twitter and attaching crypto tokens to celebrities. It essentially created a stock market for famous people, with the price of the tokens rising and falling based on how popular the person was. The public – and legal — backlash was swift. Brandon Curtis, cofounder of crypto company Rio Network, hit Al-Naji with a cease-and-desist letter, saying BitClout used his likeness without consent. Lee Hsien Loong, the former Prime Minister of Singapore, even made a public plea asking for his BitClout profile to be removed. “It is misleading and done without my permission,” he wrote on Facebook.  At the time, many wondered why such esteemed firms had backed such a polarizing concept. Sources close to the company explained that, in crypto circles, Al-Naji had earned goodwill after his previous company, Basis. In 2018, the Princeton grad had raised a whopping $140 million to create a stablecoin. But shortly after Al-Naji realized the regulatory environment was too inhospitable to crypto and he decided to return the money, these sources said. Investors got back about 93 cents on the dollar, according to a person close to Al-Naji. So, in early 2021, when Al-Naji approached investors with a new idea, they were inclined to give him a second chance. According to sources close to the company, Al-Naji raised his seed round on the broad pitch of a decentralized social media platform, with no emphasis on the social stock market. But then, in April, Al-Naji intended to quietly test the stock market feature, locking it behind a password-protected webpage. The password promptly leaked and the feature went viral, suddenly becoming a huge focal point for Al-Naji. This upset several investors, according to multiple sources. The company eventually steered back to its original pitch, focusing instead on its DeSo Blockchain, a blockchain “built specifically for decentralizing social networks,” according to the BitClout website. Still, immediately after the scraping brouhaha, plenty of tech bigwigs publicly defended BitClout. Investors like a16z’s Andrew Chen, Michael Arrington and angel investor Shaan Puri poured thousands into buying tokens on the platform. Chen posted on BitClout about a month after its launch, writing about how the app has a “really interesting approach” by incentivizing users with financial rewards. And, in a post by Sequoia Capital’s Shaun Maguire, the investor praised Al-Naji’s “transformative vision” and called BitClout “instantly electrifying.” The polarization among those angry at being “traded” on BitClout without their permission and those defending the startup was made even more complicated by the fact that there wasn’t a CEO to speak to on behalf of the company. Al-Naji’s hidden identity is one of the key tenants of the SEC’s complaint, which claims that he made BitClout appear like there was “no company behind it … just coins and code,” when he allegedly was, the commission claims, pocketing millions in profit. “Al-Naji attempted to evade the federal securities laws and defraud the investing public, mistakenly believing that ‘being ‘fake” decentralized generally confuses regulators and deters them from going after you,’” said Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, in a statement released by the SEC. “He is obviously wrong.” Sequoia and a16z declined to comment. While Al-Naji has yet to speak on the allegations, he previously expressed confidence in his company’s legal footing. At an event in late 2021, he reflected on his previous crypto company and how he spent $10 million on lawyers. The lawyers, he said, taught him all about securities and the law around crypto currencies – lessons he took with him to BitClout. “I learned a lot,” he said. “And I think we did it right this time.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsa16z, a16z crypto, Crypto, Securities and Exchange Commission, Sequoia Partners, Startups, Venture, winklevoss capital \t\tApps\tX is getting closer to launching its payment serviceLauren Forristal\t1 hour agoX (formerly Twitter) appears to be making progress on its upcoming payments system, bringing it closer to Elon Musk’s vision of turning X into an “everything app.”   According to a… \t\tSpace\tDawn Aerospace’s rocket-propelled aircraft takes flightAria Alamalhodaei\t1 hour agoDawn Aerospace’s rocket-powered aircraft soared to new heights in its latest test campaign, as the company looks to build what could be the highest-performance aircraft to take off from a… \t\tHardware\tMade by Google 2024: Pixel 9, Gemini, a new foldable and other things to expect from the eventBrian Heater\t1 hour agoGoogle unveiled the Nest Learning Thermostat 4 and Google TV Streamer.

That said, it is nowhere near nonexistent on this front. To wit: Growth equity investor Kennet of London just announced it has raised €266 million for its largest fund to date, Kennet VI, which is already being deployed into B2B SaaS companies across Europe.Kennet focuses exclusively on backing established B2B SaaS startups that are founder-owned and either highly capital efficient or fully bootstrapped, meaning they’re built without external capital. A good example of this is the conference networking app Grip, which raised $13 million in 2021, with Kennet leading the round. The Kennet VI fund follows the previous five funds Kennet has run over the last 25 years. Its most recent exit was with Eloomi in January 2024. The learning experience platform was acquired by floated software company Ceridian. Kennet said this generated a 3.1x cash multiple. Earlier (numerous) exits include Nuxeo (a 5x exit), Dext (3.8x), CrossBorder Solutions (6.4x), Rimilia (2.5x), and Impartner (2.6x).Investment from Kennet is typically the first external funding that companies receive and is used to scale and expand internationally, build world-class management teams, and amass strategic value.In an interview with TechCrunch, Hillel Zidel, managing director, Kennet Partners, said: “This new fund is very consistent with what we’ve done in the prior funds, which is B2B software focused on bootstrapped and capital efficient companies at the growth stage. “We’re probably the only group with an exclusive focus on this category. And with each client, we just want to do more and more in terms of, you know, being of service to bootstrap founders. The exits we’ve had demonstrate that if you invest in good businesses that have strategic value, you’re not dependent on a particular market cycle to be able to exit successfully.”The Kennet VI fund was raised in partnership with cornerstone investor Edmond de Rothschild Private Equity, which started investing in the fund in 2017. Bpifrance, British Patient Capital and Federated Hermes Private Equity also committed to the fund.There’s been a rise in growth funds in Europe. Earlier this year Index Ventures announced $2.3 billion in new funds, spread across different stages, with $800 million dedicated to venture investment and $1.5 billion set aside for growth- and late-stage companies.Aside from normal venture capital, the often quieter “growth capital” sector can frequently see great returns for entrepreneurs who prefer to retain a lot of ownership and control but are also willing to bootstrap over a longer period in order to reach revenues and profits.       More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsEurope, Growth, growth funding, Venture, venture capital \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46B in Q2 as it drives toward a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t2 hours agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost-efficient versions — a sign of… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t2 hours agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

Luckily for them, their LPs, which include fund-of-funds Cendana Capital and Accolade Partners, the Nature Conservancy, the outsourced CIO Global Endowment Management, and several universities, were eager to back the firm. Cendana founder Michael Kim described Stanton’s network as one of the deepest and widest among seed-stage investors.“It didn’t take us as long as we thought to fundraise. We’re really happy about that, but you never know,” Stanton said.Although the five-year-old firm still hasn’t realized any meaningful exits, Stanton’s pre-Moxxie personal investing record through investment collective #Angels, which she co-founded with other female Twitter executives and alums, shows her investment prowess. She previously backed Carta, Coinbase and Airtable.  The success of Moxxie’s portfolio companies has been more modest so far. When asked to highlight some companies, Stanton has pointed to startups like Certn, an identity verification company that last year raised an $80 million Series B, and Spellbook, an AI co-pilot for drafting legal contracts, which in January scored a $20 million Series A led by Innovia.Moxxie, whose name was inspired by the synonym for courage with an extra X for the female chromosome, has been on a mission of investing in underrepresented founders since its debut $25 million fund. Today, about a third of the firm’s portfolio companies are led by female founders and about a half have been founded by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), according to Stanton.While the firm considers itself a generalist investor, it gravitates toward backing companies in health tech, climate tech, SaaS, and AI applications and has recently invested in a couple of robotics startups, including Jacobi Robotics, which is developing an AI-powered motion-planning technology.

But it remains a cause for concern within enterprise settings, largely due to issues around security and data privacy.For context, large language models (LLMs) are the engines behind generative AI and enable machines to understand and generate text just like a human. But whether you want such an application to write a poem or summarize a legal contract, it needs instructions to guide its output. These “prompts,” however, can be constructed in such a way as to trick the application into doing something it’s not supposed to, such as divulging confidential data that was used to train it, or give unauthorized access to private systems. Such “prompt injections” are a real and growing concern and are specifically what Lakera is setting out to address.Prompt responseFounded out of Zurich in 2021, Lakera officially launched last October with $10 million in funding, with the express promise to protect organizations from LLM security weaknesses such as data leakage or prompt injections. It works with any LLM, including OpenAI’s GPT-X, Google’s Bard, Meta’s Llama, and Anthropic’s Claude.At its core, Lakera is pitched as a “low-latency AI application firewall” that secures traffic into and out of generative AI applications.The company’s inaugural product, Lakera Guard, is built on a database that collates insights from myriad sources, including publicly available “open source” datasets such as those hosted on Hugging Face, in-house machine learning research, and a curious interactive game it developed called Gandalf, which invites users to attempt to trick it into revealing a secret password.Lakera’s GandalfImage Credits: LakeraThe game gets more sophisticated (and thus more difficult to “hack”) as the levels progress. But these interactions have enabled Lakera to build what it calls a “prompt injection taxonomy” that separates such attacks into categories.“We are AI-first, building our own models to detect malicious attacks such as prompt injections in real time,” Lakera’s co-founder and CEO David Haber explained to TechCrunch. “Our models continuously learn from large amounts of generative AI interactions what malicious interactions look like. As a result, our detector models continuously improve and evolve with the emerging threat landscape.”Lakera Guard in action.Image Credits: LakeraLakera says that by integrating their application with the Lakera Guard API, companies can better safeguard against malicious prompts. However, the company has also developed specialized models that scan prompts and application outputs for toxic content, with dedicated detectors for hate speech, sexual content, violence and profanities.“These detectors are particularly useful for publicly facing applications, for example chatbots, but are used in other settings as well,” Haber said.Similar to its prompt defense tool set, companies can integrate Lakera’s content moderation smarts with a single line of code and can get access to a centralized policy control dashboard to fine-tune the thresholds they want to set according to the content type.Lakera Guard content moderation controls.Image Credits: LakeraWith a fresh $20 million in the bank, Lakera is now primed to expand its global presence, particularly in the U.S. The company already claims a number of fairly high-profile customers in North America, including U.S.-based AI startup Respell and Canadian mega-unicorn Cohere.“Large enterprises, SaaS companies and AI model providers are all racing to roll out secure AI applications,” Haber said. “Financial services organizations understand the security and compliance risks and are early adopters, but we are seeing interest across industries. Most companies know they need to incorporate GenAI into their core business processes to stay competitive.”Aside from lead backer Atomico, Lakera’s Series A round included participation from Dropbox’s VC arm, Citi Ventures and Redalpine.

But nobody really likes the idea of using more chemical pesticides. Thomas Laurent’s company, Micropep, thinks the answer might already be in the plants themselves.Micropep is exploring how naturally occurring compounds known as micropeptides might work as an entirely new class of pesticides. If the startup succeeds, its products promise to be more effective and less toxic than existing synthetic pesticides.Micropeptides are small proteins, fewer than 100 amino acids long. For years, researchers ignored the genes coded for these proteins, thinking they were too small to do anything meaningful. They were wrong. Micropeptides are helpful for many things, including organ development and communication within and between cells. Perhaps most useful, they can act as switches within a cell, telling which functions to turn on and off.When it comes to fighting pests and pathogens, such fine control can be pretty useful. Micropep’s first approach is most similar to that employed by antibiotics. The startup’s first products can be sprayed on the leaves of soybean plants. There, it will wait for specific fungi to land on the leaves. When a fungal spore lands and begins to grow, the micropeptide will target the fungus’s cell membrane, forcing it to self-destruct.If Micropep can make it work, the potential impact could be significant. Agriculture is responsible for about a quarter of greenhouse gases worldwide. Pests consume about 20% to 30% of all major crops. As the world heats up, insect pests alone will eat up to 25% more grain for every degree Celsius of warming. In other words, pests make agriculture less efficient and climate change supercharges them, all of which makes ag’s climate impact that much bigger.Still, the company faces several challenges before the first farmer can buy Micropep at the supply store. For one, micropeptides don’t fare well in the wild. When they hit the soil, enzymes produced by microbes break them down quickly. To cope with that, the company has been exploring a number of strategies to help its micropeptides last longer.First, Micropep will start above the soil, with the product for soybean leaves. “We found ways to optimize it so that it remains stable for a few days. But in the soil the persistence is very, very brief,” Laurent said.To find more durable micropeptides, the startup has developed a series of models that allow it to predict the behavior of various candidates. This year, it will test 1,000 to 2,000 of the most promising ones in the lab. From there, the best 50 to 100 will be deployed in greenhouse trials.“The final stage for efficacy is going into the field,” Laurent said. “We’re running field trials, and for that, there’s a much smaller number of lead candidates that are interesting.”The company is currently working through regulatory trials in the U.S., Brazil and Europe, Laurent said. Micropep plans to have its products in regulatory review by 2026 with the hope that they will be live in the U.S. and Brazil by 2028 and Europe by 2030.In a future generation of Micropep’s technology, micropeptides will also help boost a plant’s natural ability to fight invaders. But just like how battling a virus exhausts people, warding off pests and pathogens saps a plant’s energy. The trick is to turn on the right defenses at just the right time.Laurent said that Micropep will partner with different companies that can use the ingredients in their products, as opposed to developing the products itself, to find better reach in a diverse and spread out market.“It’s a very, very, very fragmented market and highly competitive,” Laurent said. “You have different species of crops; some farmers are growing soy and some farmers who are growing grapes. So you need to find ways to get to those different customers.”Micropep recently raised a $29 million Series B round led by Zebra Impact Ventures and BPI Green Tech Investments. Existing investors, including Fall Line Capital, FMC Ventures and Sofinnova Partners, also participated, among others. Laurent said the funding is being used for Micropep’s go-to-market strategy.

This earned them a spot in Y Combinator’s summer 2023 cohort, but the co-founders quickly realized building general AI agents was too broad. So now Reworkd is a web-scraping company, specifically building AI agents to extract structured data from the public web.AgentGPT provided a simple interface in a browser where users could create autonomous AI agents. Soon, everyone was raving about how agents were the future of computing.When the tool took off, Asim Shrestha, Adam Watkins, and Srijan Subedi were still living in Canada and Reworkd didn’t exist. The massive user influx caught them off guard; Subedi, now Reworkd’s COO, said the tool was costing them $2,000 a day in API calls. For that reason, they had to create Reworkd and get funded fast. One of the most popular use cases for AgentGPT was creating web scrapers, a relatively simple but high-volume task, so Reworkd made this its singular focus.Web scrapers have become invaluable in the AI era. The number one reason organizations use public web data in 2024 is to build AI models, according to Bright Data’s latest report. The problem is that web scrapers are traditionally built by humans and must be customized for specific web pages, making them expensive. But Reworkd’s AI agents can scrape more of the web with fewer humans in the loop.Customers can give Reworkd a list of hundreds, or even thousands, of websites to scrape and then specify the types of data they’re interested in. Then Reworkd’s AI agents use multimodal code generation to turn this into structured data. Agents generate unique code to scrape each website and extract that data for customers to use as they please.For example, say you want stats on every NFL player, but every team’s website has a different layout. Instead of building a scraper for each website, Reworkd’s agents do that for you given just links and a description of the data you want to extract. With 32 teams, that could save you hours — but if there were 1,000 teams, it could save you weeks.Reworkd raised a fresh $2.75 million in seed funding from Paul Graham, AI Grant (Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’ startup accelerator), SV Angel, General Catalyst and Panache Ventures, among others, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. Combined with a $1.25 million pre-seed investment last year from Panache Ventures and Y Combinator, this brings Reworkd’s total funding raised to date to $4 million.AI that can use the internetShortly after forming Reworkd and moving to San Francisco, the team hired Rohan Pandey as a founding research engineer. He currently lives in AGI House SF, one of the Bay Area’s most popular hacker houses for the AI era. One investor described Pandey as a “one person research lab within Reworkd.”“We see ourselves as the culmination of this 30-year dream of the Semantic Web,” said Pandey in an interview with TechCrunch, referring to a vision of world wide web inventor Tim Berners-Lee in which computers can read the entire internet. “Even though some websites don’t have markup, LLMs can understand the websites in the same ways that humans can, in such that we can expose basically any website as an API. So in some sense, Reworkd is like the universal API layer for the internet.”Reworkd says it’s able to capture the long tail end of customer data needs, meaning its AI agents are specifically good for scraping thousands of smaller public websites that large competitors often skip over. Others, such as Bright Data, have scrapers for large websites like LinkedIn or Amazon already built out, but it may not be worth the trouble for a human to build a scraper for every small website. Reworkd addresses this concern, but potentially raises others.What exactly is “public” web data?Though web scrapers have existed for decades, they have attracted controversy in the AI era. Unfettered scraping of huge swathes of data has thrown OpenAI and Perplexity into legal trouble: News and media organizations allege the AI companies extracted intellectual property from behind a paywall, reproducing it widely without payment. Reworkd is taking precautions to avoid these issues.“We look at it as uplifting the accessibility of publicly available information,” said Shrestha, co-founder and CEO of Reworkd, in an interview with TechCrunch. “We’re only allowing information that’s publicly available; we’re not going through sign-in walls or anything like that.”To go a step further, Reworkd says it’s avoiding scraping news altogether, and being selective about who they work with. Watkins, the company’s CTO, says there are better tools for aggregating news content elsewhere, and it is not their focus.As an example of what is, Reworkd described their work with Axis, a company that helps policy teams comply with government regulations. Axis uses Reworkd’s AI to extract data from thousands of government regulation documents for many countries across the European Union. Axis then trains and fine-tunes an AI model based on this data and offers it to clients as a product.Starting a web-scraping company these days could be considered wading into dangerous territory, according to Aaron Fiske, partner at Silicon-Valley based law firm Gunderson Dettmer. The landscape is somewhat fluid right now, and the jury is still out on how “public” web data really is for AI models. However, Fiske says Reworkd’s approach, where customers decide what websites to scrape, may insulate them from legal liability.“It’s like they invented the copying machine, and there’s this one use case for making copies that turned out to be hugely economically valuable, but also legally, really questionable,” said Fiske in an interview with TechCrunch. “It’s not like web scrapers servicing AI companies is necessarily risky, but working with AI companies that are really interested in harvesting copyrighted content is maybe an issue.”That’s why Reworkd is being careful about who it works with. Web scrapers have obfuscated much of the blame in potential copyright infringement cases related to AI thus far. In the OpenAI case, Fiske points out that The New York Times did not sue the web scraper that collected its articles, but rather the company that allegedly reproduced its work. But even there, it’s yet to be decided if what OpenAI did was truly copyright infringement.There’s more evidence that web scrapers are legally in the clear during the AI boom. A court recently ruled in favor of Bright Data after it scraped Facebook and Instagram profiles via the web. One example in the court case was a dataset of 615 million records of Instagram user data, which Bright Data sells for $860,000. Meta sued the company, alleging this violated its terms of service. But a court ruled that this data is public and therefore available to scrape.Investors think Reworkd scales with the big guysReworkd has attracted big names as early investors, from Y Combinator and Paul Graham to Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman. Some investors say this is because Reworkd’s technology stands to improve, and get cheaper, alongside new models. The startup says OpenAI’s GPT-4o is currently the best for its multimodal code generation and that a lot of Reworkd’s technology wasn’t possible until just a few months ago.“If you try to compete with the rate of technology progress — not building on top of it — then I think that you’ll have a hard time as a founder,” General Catalyst’s Viet Le told TechCrunch. “Reworkd has the mindset of basing its solution on the rate of progress.”Reworkd is creating AI agents that address a particular gap in the market; companies need more data because AI is advancing quickly. As more companies build custom AI models specific to their business, Reworkd stands to gain more customers. Fine-tuning models necessitates quality, structured data, and lots of it.Reworkd says its approach is “self-healing,” meaning that its web scrapers won’t break down due to a web page update. The startup claims to avoid hallucination issues traditionally associated with AI models because Reworkd’s agents are generating code to scrape a website. It’s possible the AI could make a mistake and grab the wrong data from a website, but Reworkd’s team created Banana-lyzer, an open source evaluation framework, to regularly assess its accuracy.Reworkd doesn’t have a large payroll — the team is just four people — but it does have to take on considerable inference costs for running its AI agents. The startup expects its pricing to get increasingly competitive as these costs trend downward. OpenAI just released GPT-4o mini, a smaller version of its industry-leading model with competitive benchmarks. Innovations like these could make Reworkd more competitive.Paul Graham and AI Grant did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Now he wants to help creators own theirsMaxwell Zeff8:48 AM PDT • July 24, 2024CommentImage Credits: LumiThousands of stories have been written about former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick. If anyone knows a thing or two about losing control of your own narrative, it’s him. Now Kaepernick is launching an AI storytelling platform, Lumi, to help creators tell and own their stories.If you said, “Huh?” when reading that, I wouldn’t blame you. But the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback has more expertise here than you might realize. First off, Kaepernick says this is a solution for storytellers, and generative AI is merely a tool to get there. Kaepernick spent the last 10 years building a media company, Kaepernick Media, which exposed him to some of the media industry’s deeply entrenched problems. He’s also served on Medium’s board since 2020. Lumi attempts to address issues like gatekeeping, production costs, and creatives losing ownership of their work. The solution is not revolutionary — an AI subscription, a distribution platform, and a revenue share plan — but the implementation might be.Kaepernick made headlines during the 2016 NFL season, not for his passer rating, but for kneeling during the national anthem before football games. It was a protest to civil injustices against Black people, but many took his kneel to be disrespectful. At the time, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said, “I don’t necessarily agree with what he’s doing,” while others, including former President Trump, said worse. After leaving the 49ers, Kaepernick struggled to land with another team despite leading San Francisco to a Super Bowl a few years earlier, leading to suspicions he’d been blackballed by NFL owners.“On my own story — the impact and implications of other people creating their narratives around it and telling it from their perspective — why should that be the case?” said Kaepernick in an interview with TechCrunch. “There are times in the past where I could have jumped out and told my story in different ways, but I try to be thoughtful of how I’m building things and why I’m doing them. If it’s something that is just self-interested or self-fulfilling, that doesn’t particularly interest me.”But with Lumi, Kaepernick sees an opportunity to empower storytellers more broadly. He may release a story on the platform himself, but that’s not quite the point. Kaepernick’s difficulties with the media industry have greatly impacted his own life, but now he’s using the lesson to create a solution larger than himself. On Wednesday, Lumi is emerging from stealth with $4 million in seed funding led by Seven Seven Six. The company is also allowing creators to sign up for its beta version today. Cool! So what is it?Kaepernick ultimately sees Lumi as an end-to-end media company — venturing into video eventually — offering creator tools, a distribution platform, publishing and merchandising services. For now, Lumi is starting small with creator tools for comic book illustrators, specifically the Japanese style, manga.The first thing creators do when storytelling with Lumi is visit the website. There, you can create your story’s main character by describing their backstory, physical characteristics, and other traits into a text-based AI model. That leads to an AI image generation of your character, which illustrators could use as inspiration or the actual character imagery to build a story around.Then Lumi’s AI helps you plan out your story, asking questions about story structure, protagonists and antagonists, and themes and helping to generate a script. Then you’ll get to the final product page, where all the imagery, dialogue and captions are formatted into a graphic novel. You can then publish your story and a digital version will go live on the front end of Lumi’s website.But Lumi also wants to make physical publishing and merchandising easier for creators. Kaepernick says his company will handle all the business logistics so creators can focus on storytelling, making Lumi a one-stop shop for all a creator’s needs.Creators can choose from three monthly subscription tiers — $20, $40, and $75 — with more expensive tiers unlocking advanced features for creators. Kaepernick wants to share the revenue from these stories, physical copies, and merchandising with the creators.Kaepernick’s plan is centered around making Lumi an entertainment platform for manga fans. The idea is that there’s some value baked into getting a story on Lumi’s website, but that only works if people are coming to the destination.No stranger to Silicon ValleyLumi is the first startup Kaepernick has founded, but the former QB has been angel investing since 2017 and tells TechCrunch he has more than 50 investments to date. Kaepernick also sits on the board of digital publishing platform Medium and has since 2020. There, he’s worked alongside influential Silicon Valley investors — including fellow board members such as a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz, Medium co-founder Evan Williams, and Heretic Ventures founder Mariam Naficy — who he says have shaped his business sense as a tech founder.“I don’t think I woke up one day and was like, ‘Hey, I’m gonna build a tech company,’” said Kaepernick. “But we were trying to solve this problem for creators that we’re engaging with. It just so happens that the best way for us to do this is by building a tech company.”Kaepernick says he’s not worried about wading into Silicon Valley more publicly as a founder at this politically charged moment, as some Silicon Valley leaders have publicly endorsed Trump. Kaepernick has been a civil rights activist for nearly a decade, leading the Know Your Rights Camp since 2016, whose mission is to “advance the liberation and well-being of Black and Brown communities.” With Lumi, Kaepernick says he’s just focused on product.“I don’t have any concerns entering the space during this time,” said Kaepernick. “My thinking is, if we are serving our end user and creator in the best way possible, then we will have a successful company and everything else will take care of itself.”Lumi aims to uplift voices that aren’t given a sufficient platform today. Kaepernick’s business will use a few different foundational AI models, but he’s keen to address the biases that have plagued LLMs for years.“AI models as they exist today, they’re going to have the biases of the past built into them. We’ve seen that, we know that,” says Kaepernick. “When we think about narratives and how people are represented, AI is going to accelerate things exponentially. That can be both exponentially good and bad. Our hope here is that we build something to create that better path forward for storytellers and creators.

Alongside Crunchbase, we’ve been tracking funding levels to pinpoint moments of progress and regression for marginalized entrepreneurs.For example, Black founders saw record amounts of funding in the bull year that was 2021, but that amount dipped substantially as the market cooled and as many DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) measures retreated. Women, on the other hand, have seen consistent funding for the past few years — hovering around 2%. Funding for mixed-gender teams, however, has been on the steady increase, implying that women founders see bigger checks if they bring a male co-founder along for the ride.Here are all the stories you need to know to stay up-to-date on the highs and lows of funding for marginalized communities.Read about funding for Black foundersFunding to Black founders has been on a steady decline since 2021, implying that investors have either lost interest or focus on backing Black founders. This is a big deal because after the murder of George Floyd, the venture and startup ecosystem made promises to better support Black founders. It seems, though, that many of those commitments have fallen to the wayside. Last year, Crunchbase found that Black founders in the U.S. raised 0.48% of all venture dollars allocated last year — that’s around $661 million out of $136 billion.Q4/2023 Overall: Funding to Black founders was down in 2023 for the third year in a rowQ3’23: Black founders received 0.13% of capital this Q3Q2/H1’23: Commentary: The old guard in venture reigns supremeQ1’23: At 0.69% in Q1, the dip in funding for Black founders ‘no longer evokes an emotional responseSince 2022, TechCrunch has been speaking with experts to find out what is needed to help boost funding to Black founders. The story has not changed in over a decade, it turns out. For years, Black people in the ecosystem have been calling for more opportunities, more money, more trust, less bias, and less pattern-matching. None of this seems to be happening as of yet.In 2022, Black founders raised just 1% of all venture funding, which, believe it or not, was a dip from the 1.3% raised in the record-breaking year that was 2021.Q4/2022 Overall: Black founders still raised just 1% of all VC funds in 2022Q3’22: Black startup founders raised just $187 million in the third quarterQ2/H1’22: Black founders are seeing a decrease in funding amid economic downturn Contact Us\t\tDo you have a tip or story you would like to share about being a woman, person of color, or a marginalized individual working in venture capital or startups?

The somewhat good news is that funding to mixed-gender teams is seeing an increase; it’s only solo women founders who seem to face more challenges when it comes to raising money from investors.2024 H’1: Female-founded startups have raised $15.5 billion so far this year, but that’s not really good news2023 Overall: Funding for female founders remained consistent in 2023 Q3’23: Q3 data for women is just more of the same Q2/H1’23: Startups with all-women founding teams raised just $1.4B in H1Q1’23: At just 2.1% of all VC investment, funding for women remains ‘meh’ in Q1 2023Funding last year also saw some highs and lows, but still nothing dramatic enough to shift the needle for solo women founders.2022 Overall: Women-founded startups raised 1.9% of all VC funds in 2022, a drop from 2021Q3’22: The highs and lows of Q3 venture capital data for women startup foundersRead about funding to other marginalized groupsBlack founders and women dominate the conversation when it comes to inequitable funding, but in reality, other communities also face challenges when looking for investor money. Latino founders also face difficulties raising capital, with funding allocated to that group often as low as it is to the Black community.Q3’22: Latin American founders see VC funding drop as investors retreat from underrepresented cohorts Members of the LGBTQ community also face their own set of challenges when looking for investor capital. To help gather data, last year, Crunchbase announced it would officially start tracking the amount of venture capital dollars allocated to LGBTQ+ founders.Trans founders to VCs: ‘Cut me a check’Read commentary on the fundingExperts, investors, and founders alike have had many thoughts on the funding levels for marginalized groups.

Neuberger Berman, Type One Ventures, Cisco, KDDI and Samsung Catalyst Fund also participated.The tranche, which brings Groq’s total raised to over $1 billion and values the company at $2.8 billion, is a major win for Groq, which reportedly was originally looking to raise $300 million at a slightly lower ($2.5 billion) valuation. It more than doubles Groq’s previous valuation (~$1 billion) in April 2021, when the company raised $300 million in a round led by Tiger Global Management and D1 Capital Partners.Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun will serve as a technical advisor to Groq and Stuart Pann, the former head of Intel’s foundry business and ex-CIO at HP, will join the startup as chief operating officer, Groq also announced today. LeCun’s appointment is a bit unexpected, given Meta’s investments in its own AI chips — but it undoubtedly gives Groq a powerful ally in a cutthroat space.Groq, which emerged from stealth in 2016, is creating what it calls an LPU (language processing unit) inference engine. The company claims its LPUs can run existing generative AI models similar in architecture to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GPT-4o at 10x the speed and one-tenth the energy.Groq CEO Jonathan Ross’ claim to fame is helping to invent the tensor processing unit (TPU), Google’s custom AI accelerator chip used to train and run models. Ross teamed up with Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at Google parent company Alphabet’s X moonshot lab, to co-found Groq close to a decade ago.Groq provides an LPU-powered developer platform called GroqCloud that offers “open” models like Meta’s Llama 3.1 family, Google’s Gemma, OpenAI’s Whisper and Mistral’s Mixtral, as well as an API that allows customers to use its chips in cloud instances. (Groq also hosts a playground for AI-powered chatbots, GroqChat, that it launched late last year.) As of July, GroqCloud had more than 356,000 developers; Groq says that a portion of the proceeds from the round will be used to scale capacity and add new models and features.“Many of these developers are at large enterprises,” Stuart Pann, Groq’s COO, told TechCrunch. “By our estimates, over 75% of the Fortune 100 are represented.”A close-up look at Groq’s LPU, which is designed to accelerate certain AI workloads.Image Credits: GroqAs the generative AI boom continues, Groq faces increasing competition from both rival AI chip upstarts and Nvidia, the formidable incumbent in the AI hardware sector.Nvidia controls an estimated 70% to 95% of the market for AI chips used to train and deploy generative AI models, and the firm’s taking aggressive steps to maintain its dominance. Nvidia has committed to releasing a new AI chip architecture every year, rather than every other year as was the case historically. And it’s reportedly establishing a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including AI hardware.Beyond Nvidia, Groq competes with Amazon, Google and Microsoft, all of which offer — or will soon offer — custom chips for AI workloads in the cloud. Amazon has its Trainium, Inferentia and Graviton processors, available through AWS; Google Cloud customers can use the aforementioned TPUs and, in time, Google’s Axion chip; and Microsoft recently launched Azure instances in preview for its Cobalt 100 CPU, with Maia 100 AI Accelerator instances to come in the next several months.Groq could consider Arm, Intel, AMD and a growing number of startups as rivals, too, in an AI chip market that could reach $400 billion in annual sales in the next five years, according to some analysts. Arm and AMD in particular have blossoming AI chip businesses, thanks to soaring capital spending by cloud vendors to meet the capacity demand for generative AI.D-Matrix late last year raised $110 million to commercialize what it’s characterizing as a first-of-its-kind inference compute platform. In June, Etched emerged from stealth with $120 million for a processor custom-built to speed up the dominant generative AI model architecture today, the transformer. SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son is reportedly looking to raise $100 billion for a chip venture to compete Nvidia. And OpenAI is said to be in talks with investment firms to launch an AI chip-making initiative.To carve out its niche, Groq is investing heavily in enterprise and government outreach.In March, Groq acquired Definitive Intelligence, a Palo Alto-based firm offering a range of business-oriented AI solutions, to form a new business unit called Groq Systems. Within Groq Systems’ purview is serving organizations, including U.S. government agencies and sovereign nations, that wish to add Groq’s chips to existing data centers or build new data centers using Groq processors.More recently, Groq partnered with Carahsoft, a government IT contractor, to sell its solutions to public sector clients through Carahsoft’s reseller partners, and the startup has a letter of intent to install tens of thousands of its LPUs at European firm Earth Wind & Power’s Norway data center.Groq is also collaborating with Saudi Arabian consulting firm Aramco Digital to install LPUs in future data centers in the Middle East.At the same time it’s establishing customer relationships, Mountain View, California-based Groq is marching toward the next generation of its chip. Last August, the company announced that it would contract with Samsung’s foundry business to manufacture 4nm LPUs, which are expected to deliver performance and efficiency gains over Groq’s first-gen 13nm chips.Groq says it plans to deploy more than 108,000 LPUs by the end of Q1 2025.

On Monday, OpenAI said it’s changing the format of its DevDay conference from a tentpole event into a series of on-the-road developer engagement sessions. The company also confirmed that it won’t release its next major flagship model during DevDay, instead focusing on updates to its APIs and developer services.“We’re not planning to announce our next model at DevDay,” an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We’ll be focused more on educating developers about what’s available and showcasing dev community stories.”OpenAI’s DevDay events this year will take place in San Francisco on October 1, London on October 30, and Singapore on November 21. All will feature workshops, breakout sessions, demos with the OpenAI product and engineering staff and developer spotlights. Registration will cost $450 (or $0 through scholarships available for eligible attendees), with applications to close on August 15.OpenAI has in recent months taken more incremental steps than monumental leaps in generative AI, opting to hone and fine-tune its tools as it trains the successor to its current leading models GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. The company has refined approaches to improving the overall performance of its models and preventing those models from going off the rails as often as they previously did, but OpenAI appears to have lost its technical lead in the generative AI race — at least according to some benchmarks.One of the reasons could be the increasing challenge of finding high-quality training data. OpenAI’s models, like most generative AI models, are trained on massive collections of web data — web data that many creators are choosing to gate over fears that their data will be plagiarized or that they won’t receive credit or pay. More than 35% of the world’s top 1,000 websites now block OpenAI’s web crawler, according to data from Originality.AI. And around 25% of data from “high-quality” sources has been restricted from the major datasets used to train AI models, a study by MIT’s Data Provenance Initiative found.Should the current access-blocking trend continue, the research group Epoch AI predicts that developers will run out of data to train generative AI models between 2026 and 2032. That — and fear of copyright lawsuits — has forced OpenAI to enter costly licensing agreements with publishers and various data brokers.OpenAI is said to have developed a reasoning technique that could improve its models’ responses on certain questions, particularly math questions, and the company’s CTO Mira Murati has promised a future model with “Ph.D.-level” intelligence. (OpenAI revealed in a blog post in May that it had begun training its next “frontier” model.) That’s pledging a lot — and there’s high pressure to deliver. OpenAI’s reportedly hemorrhaging billions of dollars training its models and hiring top-paid research staff.OpenAI still faces many controversies, such as using copyrighted data for training, restrictive employee NDAs, and effectively pushing out safety researchers. The slower product cycle might have the beneficial side effect of countering the narrative that OpenAI has deprioritized work on AI safety in the pursuit of more capable, powerful generative AI technologies.

Now a startup developing AI market research based on that location data, Placer.ai, has quietly raised $75 million at an expanded valuation of nearly $1.5 billion, TechCrunch has learned. The startup provides a wide range of location-based analytics to companies in verticals like retail, events and entertainment, CPG, real estate, financial services and healthcare by combining AI with anonymized data that it sources from third-party apps.We first became aware of the funding by way of a Form D filed in July detailing Placer’s intentions to raise $75 million. We have confirmed with the company’s CEO and CFO that it has closed the full amount, with a new valuation of $1.45 billion, up nearly 50% since its last round, a $100 million Series C made at a $1 billion valuation. The investment underscores the growing value of location data for businesses beyond the app publishers themselves. And, at a time when more people are aware of data protection around mobile apps, not least due to a growing number of data breaches, it also serves as a reminder of just how much data we generate through modern life.Placer’s analytics cover general trends like foot traffic at a particular location or for a particular store — factoids like Aldi currently ranking as the fastest-growing retailer based on visits — but also more detailed data about who buys what and and when, people’s demographic profiles and more. Such methods are a little creepy, as some have noted, but also not totally uncommon. (Others that track location data include Foursquare, Esri and many others offer location analytics.)Like other mobile analytics firms, the startup picks up data by way of an SDK that it installs with hundreds of app publishers, as well as through other third-party sources. It describes itself as a “privacy by design” business: All of the data it uses is anonymized before it comes to Placer, the company said.The company declined to disclose specific participants in this latest fundraise except to note that existing backers participated. PitchBook notes that real estate investment firm GEM Realty Capital is also in this most recent round. Overall, Placer has more than 50 investors — both firms and individuals — on its cap table. They include Josh Buckley (the former CEO of Product Hunt), WndrCo (Jeffrey Katzenberg’s investment firm), Lachy Groom, MMC Technology Ventures, Fifth Wall Ventures and Array Ventures, alongside J.M. Schapiro (CEO of Continental Realty Corp), Eliot Bencuya and Jeff Karsh of Tryperion Partners, Daniel Klein of Klein Enterprises/Sundeck Capital and Majestic Realty.Numbers have been strong for the company. Placer’s CEO and co-founder Noam Ben-Zvi told TechCrunch in an interview that the company crossed an annual revenue run rate of $100 million in February, and it has grown 80% in the last year and expects to grow another 60% this year. It has also passed 4,300 customers (up from 1,000 in 2022 when it raised the $100 million). The list includes the likes of Sony, various city development organizations, Wegmans, and Century 21. “What ties them together is that they all have a stake in the physical world,” he said. The funding was raised based on inbound interest, CFO Dean Neese said. The plan will be to use the funding for business development and to add more features and datasets to the platform. It says it already provides users with “hundreds” of these datasets.Placer was founded in 2018 by Ben-Zvi and fellow Israelis Zohar Bar-Yehuda (data scientist), Oded Fossfeld (CTO) and Ofir Lemel (CPO), and it was just two years later that the company faced what you might assume would be a death knell for a location analytics company: the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic and the world turning away from physical gatherings. It turned out to be the opposite.At an especially restricted time, Ben-Zvi said, “Our data provided a lot of visibility into what was working and what was not working.”Having that foothold with customers meant that the company expanded its reach along with the world “reopening” for business. While Placer has always used machine learning and inference to build more detailed profiles based on the data that they glean from apps, that has now also been a strong point with its end users, who have been given a green light to explore how to build more AI into their workflows. “Customers want a holistic one-stop-shop platform for market research,” he said. “They may ask themselves: Should I expand to this market? How are my competitors doing? What they want is all the underlying data that’s relevant, and all the aggregations and the tools on top. Analytics is a core ingredient.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsAI, business analytics, Fundraising, location intelligence, Placer.ai, retailers, Startups \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46 billion in Q2 as it drives towards a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t44 mins agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost efficient versions — a sign… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t56 mins agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

Before we dive in, I wanted to quickly plug this year’s TechCrunch Disrupt, our flagship event.

In an information vacuum, conspiracies flourish, and at this point, I’m not surprised that people are starting to seriously wonder whether Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will be returning home on Starliner (or whether a SpaceX Dragon will need to be used as a contingency return vehicle).Per Eric Berger at Ars, one “informed source” estimated a better than 50-50 chance the crew would return on Dragon; another said it was “significantly more likely than not” that NASA would use SpaceX’s vehicle. If this is the case, it’s hard to see a future for Starliner — and that’s even in spite of the fact that Boeing has spent around $1.6 billion on the program, in addition to the $4.2 billion contract it was awarded by NASA to develop the capsule.Image Credits: NASA (opens in a new window)Launch of the weekSpaceX launched Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus spacecraft to the ISS this week, marking Northrop’s 21st commercial cargo resupply mission for NASA. Notably, NASA did not pack extra spacesuits for Wilmore and Williams, which they’d need if they were going to return on Dragon, per agency officials during a press conference last Friday. Though the launch went as planned, NASA mission control seemed to tell astronauts on the station that there was an issue with spacecraft’s performance; hours later, the agency issued a statement, saying that Cynus failed to perform a burn of its propulsion system “due to a late entry to burn sequencing.” But the agency added that “Northrop Grumman engineers are working on a new burn and trajectory plan” to allow the spacecraft to arrive as planned at 3:10AM EST August 7.Click the link to rewatch the launch.Image Credits: Northrop GrummanWhat we’re readingI was pumped to see plans from Vast for what could be the first private microgravity lab in low Earth orbit. The company’s Haven-1 will host Redwire Space and European space biotech company Yuri, and no doubt others, given the high demand to conduct research on the International Space Station. More science in space = a win for humanity.

However, despite the number of players, launches still involve substantial transportation costs and considerable waiting periods. For instance, SpaceX launches are booked until 2026, even while on a ride-sharing model.EtherealX aims to solve this problem with a new fully reusable medium-lift vehicle, offering absolute reusability to help reduce transportation costs and cut launch timeframes. Unlike SpaceX’s Falcon 9, which provides partial reusability by bringing its booster back to Earth after successful launches, EtherealX is designing its vehicles to get both the upper stage and booster back.Founded in 2022 by Manu J. Nair (CEO), along with former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Shubhayu Sardar (COO) and aerospace engineer Prashant Sharma (CTO), the Bengaluru-headquartered startup intends to take on SpaceX with its medium-lift vehicle named Razor Crest Mk-1. In a fully reusable configuration, the design is intended to put 8 tons into the lower Earth orbit. The vehicle could also put over 24.8 tons into the lower Earth orbit in an expendable and 22.8 tons in a partially reusable configuration. They claim it can also deliver payloads in geostationary transfer and trans-lunar injection orbits.Image Credits: EtherealX“When bringing back the upper stages, the reentry heat is so much that the refurbishment cost is almost always more than the fresh vehicle itself. So, we built from scratch a completely new rocket engine cycle, which, coupled with the deployment system, allows us to operate our engines efficiently in both vacuum and atmosphere,” said Nair in an interview.The startup claims that it can operate between $350 and $2,000 per kilogram, a fraction of what launch vehicles, including Falcon 9, currently offer and 1/35th of the global average launch price.“At the price point at which we will enter the market, we’ll comfortably capture 30-40% of it,” Nair told TechCrunch.The two-year-old startup has acquired 16 acres of land in Tamil Nadu, where it is developing what it says is India’s largest privately developed rocket engine facility.What’s the approach for complete reusability?Unlike conventional methodologies for fending off the reentry heat, such as heat tiles and other thermal protection systems, Nair explained to TechCrunch that EtherealX’s proprietary rocket engine cycle works along with a deployment system to redirect the reentry heat throughout the reentry phase. This helps the system to operate efficiently in both vacuum and atmosphere and allows the startup to achieve pinpoint landing as opposed to the traditional ballistic reentry, which requires a much larger range of target landing zones.“The closest model to our approach could be SpaceX’s Starship. They’re attempting to bring the upper stage back, but they’re doing it with the usage of heat shields or tiles,” the executive said. “We’re not fighting the reentry heat.”The startup declined to provide too many details on the record so it can test in secrecy.Image Credits: EtherealXCurrently, EtherealX does not produce the rocket engine in-house to avoid manufacturing-related capital expenditures and has partnered with a few companies to outsource its production. However, it does have plans to manufacture the rocket over time.“During the rocket’s development, we need to observe the most effective way of manufacturing these components so that we can establish a proper manufacturing facility, which will be tested in-house,” said Nair.EtherealX aims to test its development through a technology demonstrator vehicle (TDV), which it plans to launch in 2026. The company told TechCrunch that the startup plans for a full orbital launch to around 400 kilometers with its initial vehicle, using the same engine type as the full-scale vehicle but in a smaller count: four engines on the upper stage and one in the booster stage.The TDV will be 35 meters tall and 2.5 meters wide with a 1.2-ton capacity.The co-founder told TechCrunch that it is going with the TDV launch first to verify the telemetry and flight software for its commercial launch later.Meanwhile, the startup has already identified 35 potential customers for its 2026 launch, though it plans to go ahead with 10–15 customers initially.India’s space ecosystem has grown significantly. The South Asian nation is home to 229 space tech startups, per the Indian government data, and the ecosystem already has players building small satellite launch vehicles and solutions to offer space situational awareness and hyperspectral imagery.The Indian government projects that the country will raise its share in the global space ecosystem fourfold by 2030. In the last few months, New Delhi introduced its space policy and updated rules to attract foreign investors and companies. The country also gained global attention for events, including its successful moon landing and partnership with NASA for joining Artemis Accords.In 2023, space tech investments in India hit $126 million, up 7% from the $118 million raised in 2022 and a 235% increase from the $37.6 million in 2021, per Tracxn. The funding landscape has so far been driven by early-stage investments as the ecosystem is yet to be matured for commercial activities.EtherealX’s seed funding round, led by Indian deep tech fund YourNest, also included BIG Capital, BlueHill Capital, Campus Fund, SGgrow and Golden Sparrow Ventures.The startup plans to use its fresh funds to kick off engine test firing in the next six months and set the pitch for its TDV launch in a couple of years. It also aims to finish building its engine test facility and manufacturing the 40-kilonewton and 925-kilonewton engines.

Lucid announced Monday as part of its second-quarter earnings report that an affiliate of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund is committing another $1.5 billion, with half coming in the form of a private placement and the other half as a loan facility.The deal also further deepens the ties between Lucid and its majority owner, which has already committed to buying at least 50,000 of its EVs in the coming years, and is helping the company build a brand new factory in the Kingdom.It’s the second time Lucid has turned to Saudi Arabia for more money since Lucid’s CEO Peter Rawlinson told the Financial Times in a March 2024 interview that he was wary of being over-reliant on the Kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund. “If I adopt a mindset that there is bottomless wealth from PIF, that is very dangerous, that is something I will never do, I respect them far too much for that,” he told the financial outlet.The new funding comes as Lucid announced it lost $643 million in the second quarter of 2024, despite setting a new sales record for its electric luxury sedans that generated $200 million of revenue. Lucid reported it had $1.35 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter.Rawlinson described the injection of capital as a “resounding further endorsement” of Saudi Arabia’s long-term commitment in Lucid.“We are so aligned, this transcends a mere financial arrangement,” Rawlinson said during the company’s earnings call Monday. “We are a cornerstone of the Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Vision 2030 to transition their company to add to a sustainable economy, and we are proud to participate in this.”He also pushed back on the idea that Saudi Arabia’s interest was waning. “It’s often portrayed, how long is it before Saudi is going to get fed up with Peter playing with his cars?” he mused. “It’s not that, you know, we have regular dialogue. I have with my chairman [Turqi Alnowaiser] and we are absolutely both committed. You know, the dialogue is much more of ‘Peter keeps things on track. We want this midsize, we want these products. Is Gravity on track?’”While Lucid’s total second-quarter revenue figures show year-over-year growth — on both a quarter and six-month time frame — a deeper dive into the result reveals Saudi Arabia’s influence.On a regional basis, Lucid generated $155 million in North American sales in the second quarter, a 12% increase from the same period last year. Revenue from North American sales fell, however, when comparing results from the first six months of the year. Lucid reported $269.8 million in revenue from North America sales in the first six months of the year, a 5.7% decrease from the $286.2 million from the same six-month period in 2023. Sales in Saudi Arabia is what helped close that gap. Revenue from sales in Saudi Arabia skyrocketed 14-fold to $95.2 million in the first six months of 2024 from the same period last year. Lucid doesn’t just need money to staunch the bleeding as it tries to carve out a market for its luxury sedan, the Air. It also needs capital to help with the upcoming launch of its first electric SUV, known as Gravity. Lucid has said the Gravity will enter production by the end of 2024 and has put its hopes on it becoming a success in North America given the popularity of the form factor in the region. The company laid off about 400 employees, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in May 2024 as part of a restructuring ahead of the launch of the Gravity SUV.

Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is a major defeat for Google that could alter the way it does business and even change the structure of the internet as we know it, should the decision stand. Mehta said that Google abused its monopoly power over the search business in part by paying companies like Apple to present its search engine as the default choice on their devices and web browsers. The Justice Department and states filed the antitrust suit against Google in 2020, which kicked off in court in September 2023. Google pays companies, including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla, billions of dollars for prime placement in web browsers and on smartphones. In 2021 alone, Google spent $26 billion to be the default search engine across Apple and Android platforms. According to The New York Times, about $18 billion of that spend went to Apple alone. Google shares 36% of search ad revenue from Safari with Apple. The government has argued that paying for the dominant position effectively kneecapped competitors from being able to build up their own search engines to a scale that would give them the data and reach to stay competitive.“After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Mehta wrote in his opinion filed Monday. “It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.”Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it illegal for any person or business to monopolize, attempt to monopolize or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce. Kent Walker, Google’s president of Global Affairs, told TechCrunch the company plans to appeal the decision. Walker doubled down on Google’s previous arguments that it has used its dominant position to make the best and most useful search engine, which has benefited consumers and advertisers alike. “This decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn’t be allowed to make it easily available,” Walker told TechCrunch. “We appreciate the Court’s finding that Google is ‘the industry’s highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users’, that Google ‘has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices’, ‘has continued to innovate in search’ and that ‘Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google’s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google’s to be superior.’”The opinion caps off a years-long case — U.S. et al. v. Google — that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Department of Justice and a group of attorneys general from 38 states and territories, led by Colorado and Nebraska, filed similar but separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020, alleging that Google unfairly blocked out would-be search rivals like Bing and DuckDuckGo. The Department of Justice estimated that Google had a 90% share of the search market, a figure that Google disputed.The outcome of the case is a significant win for the Justice Department in an election year when former president Donald Trump would, should he win a second term in office, almost certainly take a decidedly more hands-off, deregulatory approach to tech. President Joe Biden’s pick to lead the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, has garnered a reputation for coming after big tech, particularly in regards to antitrust law, that many of those companies have not taken kindly to.This case could set precedent for the raft of other antitrust lawsuits making their way through the courts today. The DOJ has sued Apple for making it difficult for consumers to switch away from the iPhone. The FTC has also recently sued Meta for stamping out early competitors and Amazon for squeezing sellers on its online marketplace. Judge Mehta’s decision Monday may also impact the outcome of the Justice Department’s second antitrust suit against Google, which alleges that Google illegally monopolized the digital ads market. Arguments for that case are scheduled to begin September 9.The judge has yet to decide remedies for Google’s behavior. He could force the company to change the way it runs its search business — or order it to sell off parts of that business. The opinion could be appealed, of course, and the final verdict may differ significantly, as happened with Microsoft’s famed antitrust case in the dot-com era.In that case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft violated antitrust laws and ordered the company to be split into two entities. Microsoft appealed the decision, and an appeals court overturned the breakup order, but Microsoft still had to take certain steps that experts today say might influence Mehta’s behavioral remedies for Google. As part of Microsoft’s settlement, the company had to share its APIs with third-party companies and appoint a panel to monitor its compliance.

It joins Fintech, SaaS and Space as the other industry-focused stages — all under one big roof.We couldn’t possibly host TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 without a huge deep dive on all things artificial intelligence. So, here is our first sneak peek at the AI Stage agenda, happening all day on Wednesday, October 30. As a classic TechCrunch stage, we have some of the nascent industry’s heavy hitters, like Alexandr Wang and Aravind Srinivas, alongside our partners like Nebius AI and others!Check the prelim agenda below and keep checking back for updates — we have a lot more to add to the AI Stage.The AI Stage agenda at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024From Search Engines to Knowledge Engines: Perplexity’s Rush Toward an AI-Curated Webwith Aravind Srinivas (Perplexity)Perplexity‘s AI-powered search engine might be the next stage of interacting with the web and knowledge in general — or not. But the company is certainly risking it all to manifest that future, even if it ruffles a few feathers along the way. Hear from the CEO how the company plans to take on all comers in this new category of tech.How Generative AI Is Flooding the Web with Disinformationwith Pamela San Martin (Oversight Board), Imran Ahmed (CCDH), and speakers to be announcedAs generative AI tools become more widely available — and become cheaper, or even free, to use — they’re being abused by an array of actors, including state actors, to create deepfakes and sow disinformation online. In this session, we’ll hear from experts about the types of deepfakes now circulating the web and some possible ways to combat the threat.Are “Open” AI Models Really Better? with Ali Farhadi (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence), Irene Solaiman (Hugging Face), and speakers to be announcedThere’s a war brewing in the AI industry between companies in support of “open” AI models (models released under permissive licenses that can be fine-tuned and repurposed for a range of applications) and closed source models (models gated behind paid services and APIs). Is one approach better than the other? The answer isn’t as clear-cut as you might think. In this talk, we’ll investigate the differences between open and closed source models, as well as the subtle but important flavors of open-model licenses.Navigating AI’s Legal and Ethical Minefieldwith Sarah Myers West (AI Now), Jingna Zhang (Cara), and Ben Zhao (University of Chicago)AI’s meteoric rise has created new ethical dilemmas and exacerbated old ones, while lawsuits drop left and right. This threatens both new and established AI companies, and the creators and workers whose labor feeds the models. A panel of experts in AI, copyright, and ethics take on this complex and fast-moving problem space.But Is It Art? Generative AI’s Evolving Role in Music and Video Productionwith Mikey Shulman (Suno), Amit Jain (Luma AI), and other speakers to be announcedGenerative AI is increasingly capable of creating video, music, and other media on demand. But who actually wants it, and why? This panel of AI startups will discuss the growing markets for generative media and how they can be served without harming or displacing the artists they claim to empower.About TechCrunch Disrupt 2024TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 is where you’ll find innovation for every stage of your startup journey.

But Grok’s misinformation spread far and wide, reaching millions of users on X and beyond before it was corrected on July 31, per the letter.“While Grok is only available to X Premium and Premium+ subscribers and includes a disclaimer asking users to verify information, the false information about ballot deadlines has been captured and shared repeatedly in multiple posts,” the secretaries of state wrote. Musk has come under fire for how X has handled moderating political topics — and for stoking the flames himself.Data suggests that X has significantly fewer moderation staff than other platforms, partly a consequence of Musk cutting an estimated 80% of the company’s engineers dedicated to trust and safety. Earlier this year, X promised to establish a new trust and safety center of excellence in Austin, Texas. But the company ended up hiring far fewer moderators for the center than initially projected, according to Bloomberg.Musk hasn’t exactly been a poster child for fact-checking. The CEO last Friday reshared a video, seemingly against his platform’s own guidelines, that used AI to clone Harris’ voice making her appear to admit to being a “diversity hire” and saying that she “doesn’t know the first thing about running the country.” The billionaire then posted “civil war is inevitable” in response to riots across the U.K. sparked by the murder of three girls last week and the spread of misinformation about the perpetrator, prompting the U.K.’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, to issue a sharp condemnation.

The feature follows Arc Browser’s addition of Boosts last year, which similarly lets users remove features from a site and further customize its appearance.Apple is rolling out the early version of the feature this week through new developer betas of iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.Users can access the Distraction Control tool from the Page Menu in the Smart Search field. They then select the item on the website they want to remove. Safari will remember to remove the elements the next time they visit the site. The choice doesn’t currently sync across hardware, however, so users will have to hide the elements on each new device.Users can click on the blue Hide icon in the search field and select “Show hidden items” to unhide any of the web page’s elements.Apple said that the feature won’t remove ads or sections that have frequently changing content. It’s not clear if this tool will be able to remove, for example, a section like “Who to follow” or “Explore” on X, as these elements appear in the same place on the home page, but the content within those boxes is dynamic.Arc Browser’s Boost tool was able to remove these sections during our testing last year.With iOS 18, Apple also introduced a redesigned reader for better listening and font controls. It also launched Highlights, a feature that will surface important information from a page, including quick links for driving directions, call information and summaries of TV show reviews mentioned on a page.

First time to relax since co-founding OpenAI 9 years ago. The mission is far from complete; we still have a safe AGI to build.— Greg Brockman (@gdb) August 6, 2024Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year after leading products at Meta, Uber, and Airtable, also exited some time ago, the company confirmed. The news of Brockman’s and Deng’s departures was earlier reported by The Information.A spokesperson shared this statement about Schulman: “We’re grateful for John’s contributions as a founding team member at OpenAI and his dedicated efforts in advancing alignment research. His passion and hard work have established a strong foundation that will inspire and support future innovations at OpenAI and the broader field.”Schulman posted about the decision on X today, saying that it stemmed from a desire to deepen his focus on AI alignment — the science of ensuring AI behaves as intended — and engage in more hands-on technical work.“I’ve decided to pursue this goal at Anthropic, where I believe I can gain new perspectives and do research alongside people deeply engaged with the topics I’m most interested in,” Schulman said. “I am confident that OpenAI and the teams I was part of will continue to thrive without me.”Schulman’s involvement with OpenAI began shortly after he completed a PhD in electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. He played a pivotal role in creating the AI-powered chatbot platform ChatGPT by leading OpenAI’s reinforcement training org, which fine-tunes generative AI models to follow human instructions.Following the departure of AI safety researcher Jan Leike (who also now works at Anthropic), Schulman became the head of OpenAI’s alignment science efforts, also known as the “post-training” team. He was also a member of OpenAI’s recently formed safety committee; it’s unclear who might replace Schulman in that role.Despite the controversies swirling around OpenAI, particularly with regard to the company’s approach to and treatment of AI safety research, Schulman said that he wasn’t leaving OpenAI due to a lack of support. “Company leaders have been very committed to investment in [alignment research],” Schulman said. “My decision is a personal one, based on how I want to focus my efforts in the next phase of my career.”With Schulman’s departure, only three of OpenAI’s 11 original founders remain: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Brockman and Wojciech Zaremba, lead of language and code generation. “Thank you for everything you’ve done for OpenAI!” wrote Altman to Schulman in a post on X. “You are a brilliant researcher, a deep thinker about product and society, and mostly, you are a great friend to all of us. We will miss you tremendously and make you proud of this place.”Update: This story was originally published at 5:38 p.m. and was updated to reflect OpenAI’s confirmation of Brockman’s and Deng’s departures.

Riverlane, a specialist in quantum error correction technology, has raised $75 million to continue expanding its R&D and operations to build its operations amid a surge of interest from quantum computing customers — technologists hard at work building what could be the next great leap in computing power, if only they can tame those fail rates. Riverlane believes it holds the answer to that problem: The startup is building technology that fits on chips used in quantum computing systems and can track, predict and fix the errors generated by quantum bits (known as qubits). “Even five years ago, I would have said that only one of these qubit types is going to work,” said Steve Brierley, Riverlane’s founder and CEO, in an interview in his Cambridge office. “But actually, what we’ve seen is they’ve all progressed [along a] Moore’s law rate. It seems to me that the pieces are in place to get to the first generation of error-corrected quantum computers. And this will be really significant because it will be the first time that a quantum computer goes beyond the capability of any supercomputer.”Sources close to the company told TechCrunch that with this round, Cambridge, England-based Riverlane’s valuation is now above $400 million. And for a company that is working on breaking completely new ground in a cutting-edge field, it’s achieved another kind of first with this fundraise: It’s the first quantum computing startup in Europe to raise a Series C. In itself, this is a signal that — while quantum computing specialists are still working to scale their models — the industry is moving into more mature growth funding on the heels of confidence and commitment that they will. A trio of investors who describe themselves as focused on sustainability are coming in as first-time backers of the startup with this round. Planet First Partners is leading the Series C, with participation from ETF Partners and Singapore’s EDBI. Previous backers Cambridge Innovation Capital (CIC), Amadeus Capital Partners, the U.K.’s National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF), and Altair also invested.Quantum computing efforts are somewhat based on a leap of faith, as much of the concept has been proven only on smaller-scale efforts. Founded by Brierley while he was still a research fellow at Cambridge, where he had been researching how to solve the problem of error rates, Riverlane is very much part of that continuum. However, visiting the startup’s offices in Cambridge, there are clear signs of how activity is gradually moving from concept into production. The company has built an operations center where it is remotely linking up with early quantum computers before embedding chips into physical systems.Riverlane focuses on a product it calls Deltaflow, a combination of QEC chips and hardware, as well as software, which it says will be capable of correcting billions of errors per second. If used in a system today, the company says the tech would represent a massive jump for current quantum computing efforts, which can typically run a few hundred operations before failing due to error rates. The idea is that using error correction tech like Deltaflow can improve operations enough to run millions of operations, and with time, trillions of them. That would in turn make quantum computers usable for calculating and working on the thorniest and most complex problems in areas like pharmaceuticals, transportation, chemistry and more (perhaps even in AI applications). The company’s vision — it’s still very much a vision, even with more than 100 engineers and other specialists (it’s hiring more now) and some customers — is laid out in a quantum error correction (QEC) roadmap that it published in July, which lays out what it plans to release in future products. Riverlane doesn’t disclose its full list of customers but said it includes Rigetti Computing, Alice & Bob, QuEra Computing, Infleqtion, Atlantic Quantum and the Oak Ridge National Lab in the U.S. and the U.K.’s National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC).“We invest in companies with the potential to have a transformative impact on society and the environment,” said Nathan Medlock, managing partner at Planet First Partners, in a statement. “Riverlane’s focus on quantum error correction, coupled with its collaboration with quantum computer makers worldwide, can accelerate the global market and enable new quantum computing applications that can substantially contribute to solving social and environmental issues.”Updated to correct the spelling of Steve Brierley.

This collusion can have the effect of eliminating a variety of content and viewpoints available to consumers.GARM was founded by the World Federation of Advertisers in 2019 in a bid to “help the industry address the challenge of illegal or harmful content on digital media platforms and its monetization via advertising,” according to the organization’s site.The Judiciary report specifically addresses boycotts of X, The Joe Rogan Experience/Spotify and “Candidates, platforms, and news outlets with opposing political views.”In particular it addresses organization member concerns over Elon Musk’s acquisition of the platform then known as Twitter. One member, according to the report, suggested that fellow members stop paid advertisements on the service, contributing to a precipitous drop in revenue. “GARM’s internal documents show that GARM was asked by a member to ‘arrange a meeting and hear more about [GARM’s] perspectives about the Twitter situation and a possible boycott from many companies,” the report’s authors note. GARM also held ‘extensive debriefing and discussion around Elon Musks’ [sic] takeover of Twitter,’ providing ample opportunity for the boycott to be organized.”In her own statement, Yaccarino claims that GARM’s “illegal behavior of these organizations and their executives cost X billions of dollars.”We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words. Now, it is war. https://t.co/MEzH0vqz0p— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 6, 2024Musk was less measured in his response, posting, “We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words. Now, it is war.” The executive had similarly incendiary words for advertisers last year, stating, “If somebody’s going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money? Go f*** yourself. Go. F***. Yourself. Is that clear?”He also promised at the time to document companies participating in the boycott “in great detail.”The suit follows a recent governmental crackdown on tech antitrust. Yesterday, Google lost a landmark battle alleging the software giant of maintaining a search monopoly through illegal acts. X joined GARM in early July, noting, “X is committed to the safety of our global town square and proud to be part of the GARM community” through its Safety account.

Once a jewel in Google’s crown, the software was a key to both the company’s mobile and smart home strategies. Half a decade ago, Google was giving away Home Mini speakers in a bid to grow out its ecosystem.On Tuesday, however, ahead of next week’s Made by Google 2024 event, the company announced that Assistant is sticking around — at least on the Home/Nest side of the fence.Assistant and Alexa got a nice pop from the pandemic, as the world was suddenly forced to spend more time at home. But in more recent years, both Google and Alexa appear to have taken their feet off the gas.It’s hyperbole to say — as many have — that the smart home is dead. Plenty of Americans own smart home devices; do a quick survey of your neighborhood and see how many doorbell cameras you can spot. The promise of the smart home was never one or two connected devices per house, however. It was a fully automated connected home ecosystem.There are plenty of reasons why the whole of the world isn’t living in fully automated smart homes. For one thing, smart devices tend to be far more expensive than their dumb counterparts. For another, the landscape has been fractured for most of its existence as device companies have pushed their own apps and ecosystems. Bad experiences like that can permanently sour a consumer who was initially hooked in by the hype cycle.The assistants at the heart of these plays have had their own struggles. Samsung’s Bixby and Microsoft’s Cortana went away entirely. Even Apple seemed to stop talking up Siri. The proliferation of generative AI platforms like ChatGPT suddenly made the last generation of smart assistants seem antiquated.Earlier this year, Google let beta users opt into making its GenAI platform Gemini the default assistant on their Pixel devices. While Gemini and its apparent proclivity for putting glue on pizza weren’t ready to replace Assistant outright, the days were seemingly numbered for its predecessor.With new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered. For the time being, however, it still has a place on the home page. Along with the launch of a new Learning Thermostat and streaming set-top box, Google announced that Assistant will be sticking around its Home ecosystem, fueled by Gemini models.Gemini’s exact role in propping up Assistant will likely remain nebulous, but the most obvious application is natural language. Assistant, Alexa and their ilk have long struggled with conversations. Most interactions tend to be single queries. This is a place where generative AI excels.“You won’t have to phrase your question in a specific way — ask it in the way that feels most comfortable to you,” Google writes. “For example, ask ‘is Pluto a planet?’ and then dig deeper with ‘Could they change their minds again?’ Can’t figure out the name of that song? Just ask Google, ‘What’s that iconic basketball theme song.’ Or Assistant can tap into Gemini’s generative capabilities to have some fun during a family discussion, like ‘Help me make the case that Crocs are extremely cool — and mention sport mode.’ ”Those specific improvements are set to arrive later this year for Nest Aware subscribers as part of a public preview.Other clear applications for Gemini include the ability to summarize information — a feature at the center of Google’s push to bring generative AI to its search offerings. Whether Google sticks with Google Assistant or opts to call it Gemini across the board is really a question of branding. Apple recently gave Siri an AI-powered facelift powered by its new Apple Assistant models. Google appears poised to do the same — at least where the smart home is concerned.

Amazon confirmed Tiwary’s departure in a statement that didn’t name a successor. Amit Agarwal, who previously led Amazon India and currently oversees the emerging economies initiative for the firm, will “remain closely involved with the Amazon team,” a company spokesperson said.Amazon, which has poured more than $7 billion into India, is facing hurdles in penetrating the South Asian nation’s smaller cities and towns, where domestic rivals Flipkart, owned by Walmart, and SoftBank-backed Meesho have established stronger footholds. Industry analysts say Amazon’s struggles in these areas stem from its limited product selection for price-sensitive customers and less developed logistics networks.Meesho has surpassed Amazon in mobile app monthly active user share among e-commerce apps in India, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Tuesday. Flipkart has more than 50 million daily active users on its mobile apps in India, whereas Amazon has fewer than 40 million, according to Bank of America analysts.In urban India, the U.S. giant is grappling with intensifying competition from quick commerce firms BlinkIt, Swiggy and Zepto, which are wooing customers with fast deliveries in as little as 10 minutes. Flipkart on Monday rolled out its own quick offering in Bengaluru. Amazon recently held talks to acquire a stake in Swiggy, according to people familiar with the matter.“India is an important priority for Amazon,” Amazon added. “We are excited by the momentum and business results we have already achieved, and we are even more optimistic about the significant opportunities ahead to innovate on behalf of our customers and digitally transform lives and livelihoods.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsAmazon, Amazon India, Commerce, India \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46B in Q2 as it drives toward a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t1 hour agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost-efficient versions — a sign of… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t2 hours agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

This week, we’re looking at Revolut’s reported valuation hike, fintech unicorns, the Disrupt Fintech Stage, and more.To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important fintech stories delivered to your inbox every Tuesday at 8 a.m. PT, subscribe here.The big storyRevolut reportedly told staff last week of plans to sell up to $500 million worth of existing shares at a $45 billion valuation, according to the Financial Times. This is notable because, if true, it would make the banking giant Europe’s most valuable startup. The valuation also marks a significant jump from the $33 billion Revolut was valued at in 2021. As the FT noted, the company is “one of the few fintechs to have increased its valuation since a slowdown in venture capital hit the sector in the past two years.” In late July, Revolut was granted a banking license from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the U.K. — a significant milestone for the London-based fintech company, particularly since it had been trying to secure this license since 2021.Analysis of the weekSo far this year, 38 unicorns have been minted in the U.S. in all of 2024, according to an analysis by TC’s Dominic-Madori Davis. Of those 38, three were in the fintech space:Altruist — $1.5 billion: This fintech startup, which offers investment management for independent registered investment advisers, was founded in 2018. It raised a $169 million Series E in May, led by ICONIQ Growth, valuing the company at $1.5 billion.Aven — $1 billion: Aven, founded in 2019, is a consumer credit card company. It reached a $1 billion valuation after closing a $142 million Series D led by Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst, according to CB Insights.Octane — $1.1 billion: A company that offers instant financing on mowers and recreational vehicles, Octane raised $50 million in April, giving in a post-money valuation of $1.11 billion. Dollars and centsA new form of alternative investing: FranShares is a Chicago-based startup that wants to offer investors another form of passive income: the chance to invest in franchises for as little as $500. The company has raised $4.2 million in seed funding led by Chicago Ventures to grow its business. We’ve been covering U.S.-based insurtech startup Faye since 2022, first with its seed round and then with its Series A round in 2023. It seems they continue to be on a roll, last week announcing $31 million in Series B funding. What is keeping this online insurance company on the rise?  Well, it would appear to be the way it combines travel insurance, assistance while you are away from home, and a range of financial solutions, packed inside a comprehensive smartphone app. It might be said that in the way Lemonade managed to hit a millennial generation with a sexier-packaged insurance platform, Faye has been plowing a similar field. What else we’re writingScoop: Alex Cook, a partner at Tiger Global who oversaw some of its largest fintech investments and India deals, is departing the firm after a tenure of nearly seven years, three people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Cook has briefed multiple people around him about his departure news over the past week, although he hasn’t explained why he’s leaving. The serious, long-term negative impact of the bankruptcy of banking-as-a-service (BaaS) fintech Synapse will be significant “on all of fintech, especially consumer-facing services,” one observer has said. In the wake of that company’s collapse, other startups in the space are working hard to prove that not all BaaS companies are created equal. Partners to fintechs — Unit CEO and co-founder Itai Damti, Synctera CEO and co-founder Peter Hazlehurst, and Treasury Prime general counsel and chief compliance officer Sheetal Parikh — are working overtime to ensure their companies are operating in a compliant manner. The trio will join us onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2024 to discuss the challenges facing the industry and how their offerings are being built to protect the customers served by their fintech clients.High-interest headlinesEvolve hires ex-con Fmr Synapse compliance chief to aid recon efforts, sources sayInsurance comparison site The Zebra buys MarbleBilt Rewards elevates valuation to $3.25BN with new $150M investment (TC covered Bilt’s last raise here.)MUFG buys stake in Philippine fintech GCash for $393 millionBrazilian receivables marketplace Monkey Exchange raises $11 millionWant to reach out with a tip?

Plonts did with microbes, and it’s stinkyChristine Hall6:05 AM PDT • August 6, 2024CommentImage Credits: Plonts / Among plant-based alternative proteins, plant-based cheese continues to have a function and taste problem.That’s where Plonts comes in. Company founders Nathaniel Chu and Josh Moser say microbes are the key to what will fix the taste, smell, flavor, stretch and melt of plant-based cheese. In fact, it’s the microbes that give cheese its distinctive stink.Chu, CEO, began his career as a biologist studying complex systems, from coral disease to feces — so literally an expert in stink. While working on his PhD in biological engineering at MIT, an article on how much carbon it took to get traditional meat and dairy from farm to fork inspired him. Especially the cheese, which he said was the third most resource-intensive food after beef and lamb.“I remember thinking, I love cheese, but how could this be?” Chu told TechCrunch. While researching alternatives, he found that flavors, for example, sharpness of a cheddar and the nuttiness of Parmesan, come from microbes. If he was able to find the right microbes, he could create fermented food, in this case cheese, from many different ingredients, including plants.Chu tested that theory in 2019 by renting the corner of a pizza shop and making cheese. Figuring out the science took a few years, but finally the first proof of concept came in the form of a plant-based cheese that he describes as “nutritious, inexpensive and sustainable.” During the course of that work, Chu met Moser and got Plonts going, which went by Tezza Foods in those early years.Why microbes? Plant-based cheeses are made from things like bacteria and fungi. However, “the microbial composition of fermented food plays a pivotal role in shaping their [cheese alternatives] sensory and nutritional attributes,” according to research done by Brazilian and French food scientists in a paper published in ScienceDirect, a peer-reviewed literature database. This includes flavor and texture development, a more nutritious option — aka more protein — and better health benefits in the final product.Plonts co-founders Josh Moser and Nathaniel Chu.Image Credits: Plonts / PlontsHow Plonts makes its cheesePlonts’ cheese is made from soybeans, which are one of the most efficient ways to grow protein, according to Chu. Soybeans themselves are not very flavorful, and that is where fermentation — similar to the way beer is made — and aging, similar to the way cheese is made — help to create flavor versus using natural flavors, Moser said. The process starts with “milk” made from plants. It’s coagulated to separate out the curds and whey and then made into a solid and aged. Then comes the mixture of microbes to create the right flavor.“Cheese is an incredible product because it’s complex,” Chu said. “Cheese is not a single flavor, it’s hundreds of different flavor molecules.”That’s why he says microbes, whether mold, bacteria or yeast, are important to create that flavor. The microbes themselves are tiny sacs of hundreds of different enzymes with many different combinations.“Figuring out the balance is what gives us the diversity of flavors that we have today,” he said. He says using microbes also results is a more protein-rich cheese because microbes feed off of protein to thrive. Plonts claims its cheese has around three grams of protein per one-ounce serving versus the often zero protein of other kinds of plant-based milks.Long road ahead for plant-based cheesePlonts is not the only company working on cheese. For example, Climax Foods has its cheese in just over a dozen restaurants, while Boermarke, Brown Foods, Better Dairy, Miruku and Perfect Day are developing cheese. Meanwhile, NewMoo recently emerged from stealth with its casein proteins technology. Even big companies are giving plant-based cheeses a-go, including multinational dairy firm Bel Group, which launched plant-based versions of its The Laughing Cow cheese products in Canada. That said, there’s still a long road ahead for startups in this sector of plant-based alternatives. Plant-based cheese represents less than 0.5% of pound sales of the total cheese market, according to figures from Circana and Good Food Institute. Add to that, both dollar and pound sales declined between 2022 to 2023, 3% and 6%, respectively.Plonts is partnering with Shuggie’s Trash Pie in San Francisco.Image Credits: PlontsThe challenge is actually one of the key things that keeps Chu and Moser motivated, Moser said. The GFI report says foodservice will provide a massive runway of opportunity for the plant-based cheese market.“It’s a signal that existing products aren’t meeting consumer expectations on the three dimensions that matter most: taste, cost and nutrition,” Moser said. “We have little reason to believe that plant-based cheese can’t be as successful as plant-based milk — they’re both dairy products after all, with similar purchasing behaviors like lactose intolerance, dairy allergies and cholesterol, as well as sustainability and animal welfare concerns.” Similar to its peers, Plonts is starting with cheddar, currently working on making both loaf and slices versions. Its market entry is in foodservice, and the loaf is what the company sells directly to its restaurant and deli customers in the Bay Area and New York. Those include Court Street Grocers and Shuggie’s Trash Pie. Chu and Moser say at some point the product will be sold via retail.Buoying the company is a $12 million seed round of venture capital Chu and Moser raised in 2022. Investors include Chris Sacca’s Lowercarbon Capital, which led the round alongside investment from Accelr8, Peter Rahal’s Litani Ventures, Pillar, Ponderosa Ventures and a group of angel investors.Since then, Plonts has been heads-down building its pilot plant and getting its product ready to be sold into the foodservice market.

These databases tend to be resource-intensive from a hardware perspective and, depending on the algorithms used to orchestrate them, they can be high-latency. Often, companies are forced to make trade-offs between database cost, performance and accuracy.But it doesn’t have to be this way, says Ohad Levi, the CEO and co-founder of Hyperspace. Hyperspace is using “domain-specific computing” to accelerate two specific database tasks: lexical searches and vector searches. Lexical searches are a type of keyword-based search that look for exact matches in a database, whereas vector searches consider the semantic meaning and context of the search query.Levi claims that Hyperspace’s instances, which leverage a combination of FPGAs and GPUs, can deliver up to 10 times faster searches than traditional, non-accelerated databases.“Our product helps companies dealing with large-scale data retrieval, particularly in AI and generative AI applications,” Levi told TechCrunch. “Unstructured data is outpacing traditional search capabilities. Data retrieval solutions must meet lexical and vector search datasets to meet current market demands.”Prior to launching Hyperspace, Levi was an optimization engineer at Intel and then a product marketing lead at HP. He says he became frustrated with the limitations of legacy search solutions working for Big Tech, which led him to partner with ex-Intel design consultant Max Nigri to found Hyperspace.Hyperspace doesn’t sell its instances. Instead, it sells access to managed database software running in those instances (hosted on AWS for now). Hyperspace’s databases can handle various types of structured and unstructured data, including videos, images and text, and are priced according to size and query volume.“Hyperspace is a cloud-native managed database that works as a software-as-a-service model, priced per usage,” Levi explained. “Our team is able to design customized AI infrastructure solutions to help enterprises solve their search challenges.”Hyperspace’s performance gains are impressive if true; Levi says that the company’s instances also deliver 5x higher throughput at a 50% lower cost than a typical database. (Those are average results; in one specific point of comparison, Levi claims that Hyperspace is generally faster than Elastic.) But can Hyperspace convince companies to use a newcomer database platform when there are so many incumbents — like Azure, AWS and Google Cloud — to choose from?Levi says yes, and he claims that Hyperspace is already seeing some early customer traction. The Tel Aviv-based firm has inked deals with enterprises in the fraud prevention and e-commerce spaces, including Forter, nSure and Renovai, and tripled its annual recurring revenue and total contract volume over the last year.Hyperspace also recently closed a $9.5 million seed funding round led by MizMaa with participation from JVP and toDay Ventures. Levi says that the money will be put toward scaling up Hyperspace’s database offering to “thousands” of instances and launching a free, entry-level plan.“Hyperspace has an entire pipeline of new innovative products that will drive the search market forward and support the needs of our enterprise and small- and medium-sized clients,” Levi said. “We’re not seeing any headwinds. Every generative AI system is a search system, and search is becoming harder than before. The need for better AI infrastructure is growing daily, and with more data, the need for better search applications is becoming more apparent.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsAI, AI, chip, database, Enterprise, Funding, Fundraising, hyperspace, MizMaa Ventures, Search, startup, Startups \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46B in Q2 as it drives toward a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t1 hour agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost-efficient versions — a sign of… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t1 hour agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

That’s roughly a two-month head start for the Made by Google event, which has traditionally occurred mid-fall. It also, notably, will find the company announcing its latest flagship, the Pixel 9, ahead of the iPhone 16. Apple’s latest is set for a September announcement.Google hasn’t given justification for the shuffle. Perhaps things will be too noisy less than a month ahead of what has already become the most bizarre presidential election in modern U.S. history. The company also no doubt has a lot to discuss on the Gemini front. The new devices will almost certainly debut key new generative AI features ahead of the rest of the Android field.One tradition Google’s stuck with this year is the pre-event device reveal. The move inevitably sucks some of the oxygen out of the room before the big event, but it’s proven an effective way to generate excitement during the summer consumer electronics doldrums. In July, Google showed off two new devices: the Pixel 9 Pro and the Pixel 9 Fold, the line’s most premium entries.And on Tuesday, the company revealed a refresh to the device that gave Nest its name: The Nest Learning Thermostat 4, which comes 13 years after the release of the original and nearly a decade after the release of the Thermostat 3. The company also unveiled its latest set-top streaming box, called Google TV Streamer, and announced that Google Assistant is here to stay — at least for now.Phones built for “the Gemini era”Image Credits: GoogleBoth carry the tagline “A (foldable) phone built for the Gemini era,” setting the stage for the latest in a long line of AI-themed tech events. Gemini took center stage at Google I/O back in May, though the developer-focused event saw much more news focused on laying the groundwork for the company’s AI ambitions.In fact, Google made a conscious attempt to distance its consumer hardware offerings from the developer conference, announcing the budget-focused Pixel 8a days ahead of the event. Notably, the most intriguing consumer-facing Android AI feature this year didn’t debut on a Pixel device at all. Circle to Search arrived first on Samsung’s Galaxy S24 back in January.  Apple made its own AI splash at WWDC in June with the launch of Apple Intelligence. Cupertino doesn’t have the same generative AI firepower as Google or OpenAI, which is precisely why it’s opened itself up to partnerships with both.Apple’s approach to the category is small scale, performing as much as possible on-device. Google has taken its own steps in that direction with Gemini Nano. The significantly smaller model arrived on Pixel 8 devices via a feature drop just last month.In recent years, Google has been clear about its ambitions to grow the Pixel line beyond its long-standing second-fiddle position in the Android market. The company has been producing in-house mobile chips for several device generations now. Coupled with all of the R&D that’s been pumped into Gemini, could this be the moment Pixel finally breaks away?Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro FoldA phone built for the Gemini era.

Unsurprisingly, Gemini got significantly more screen time than the hardware. Twenty of the video’s 30 seconds are devoted to asking the GenAI to write a “breakup letter” for an old phone, in favor of “something magical.”That thing is, you guessed it, the Pixel 9 Pro, which rotates 180 degrees to reveal the camera bar to end all camera bars. Google has baked the camera bar into the Pixel’s design language, but this pronounced visor is enough to make Cyclops blush. The bar no longer runs the length of the device’s back, but the camera bump now juts out at a sharper angle.The video for Google’s latest foldable is virtually identical, though here the screen opens to reveal the words “Oh hi, AI,” before closing to showcase the device’s back. The design language on the camera bump is similar, though the foldable’s is off-center and features stacked lenses.A foldable phone built for the Gemini era. Out with the old. In with the Fold.

The company may ultimately opt to position the Pro Fold as the true premium device in the line. Even with the $100 price increase that came with last year’s Pixel 8 release, the line has undercut the likes of Samsung and Apple.The company ultimately threw caution to the wind with the first Pixel Fold, which arrived last summer with a beefy $1,799 price tag. The starting price has since come down significantly, however. You can pick one up directly from Google for $1,300. You’d be advised to wait a few weeks, though, to see what Made by Google has in store.Google is expected to announce four Pixel devices: the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL and Pixel 9 Pro Premium. All of the devices should sport the company’s latest in-house chip, the Tensor G4 and run Android 15.Android 15The latest beta of Android 14 (beta 4) dropped just last week. While I/O previewed some features, you’ll have to wait until the August 13 event for its final release. Code-named “Vanilla Ice Cream” (those delightful dessert names are still used internally), the latest version of the mobile operating system will bring new features and UI tweaks.Already announced marquee features include improved multitasking and satellite connectivity. Private Space, meanwhile, is a kind of on-device incognito mode, which brings added authentication requirements for sensitive info. An improved Doze mode, meanwhile, should improve device battery life.What about Assistant?The question of Google Assistant’s fate has loomed large over the last several Gemini updates. It’s clear that Google ultimately wants its in-house GenAI to take over Android’s most pressing tasks, but it remains to be seen whether that means replacing Assistant outright or reinforcing it the way Apple has with Siri.Users can currently rely on Gemini as their primary assistant, if they choose, though Google ultimately did the right thing and held off replacing Assistant outright.Assistant played a more central role in previous years’ Made by Google events, owing to the inclusion of Google Home/Nest announcements. As excitement around smart home devices has waned, however, the company has taken its foot off the gas. Perhaps Gemini’s arrival can breathe some much-needed life back into the space.The Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Buds Pro 2Image Credits: GoogleThe smart home category may have cooled, but Google has been plenty bullish on wearables since its 2020 Fitbit acquisition. The Pixel Watch 3 appears destined to get some stage time at the August 13 event. Ditto for Pixel Buds Pro 2.Made by Google kicks off at 10 a.m. PT on August 13. Stay tuned for more info.

Best known as the founder of tech blog Techdirt, Masnick is also credited with inspiring the Bluesky project through his paper titled “Protocols, not Platforms.“According to a company blog post, the team was already leaning on Masnick for advice, so adding him to the board is a “natural next step” in formalizing their relationship.Originally incubated within Twitter under founder Jack Dorsey’s leadership, Bluesky later spun out of Twitter (now rebranded as X under Elon Musk) and has charted its own path as an independent company. That includes raising a seed round last year and rolling out its first paid service for helping people set up custom domains on the decentralized platform.Though Bluesky had the support of Dorsey in its earlier days, the former Twitter CEO later came to publicly criticize the startup for making the same mistakes he and others made at Twitter, especially in terms of how it handled some of its earlier moderation issues.In May, Dorsey left his position on Bluesky’s board, and he now devotes more of his energy to Nostr, another decentralized network popular with Bitcoin proponents like himself.With the addition of Masnick, Bluesky fills its board opening as the now 6-million-user-strong social network continues to develop its platform and policies, as well as the technology that powers its efforts, the AT Protocol.The company says it will tap into Masnick’s expertise as a reporter, editor and publisher, in addition to gaining insights from his familiarity with policy, technology and legal issues it may face as it grows. “Mike’s work has been an inspiration to us from the start,” said Bluesky CEO Jay Graber in a statement. “Having him join our board feels like a natural progression of our shared vision for a more open internet. His perspective will help ensure we’re building something that truly serves users as we continue to evolve Bluesky and the AT Protocol.”“I’m excited to join the Bluesky board and to support its vision of building an open social network,” Masnick said. “Over the last few years, I’ve been thrilled to see how the Bluesky team has turned these ideas into reality, and I look forward to helping the company continue to build a better internet.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsApps, Bluesky, Social, Startups, twitter/x \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46B in Q2 as it drives toward a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t1 hour agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost-efficient versions — a sign of… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t1 hour agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

But this vital information is still supplied mainly by governments using inaccurate, older modeling techniques. Perceptive Space, a Canadian startup that emerged from stealth on Tuesday, is looking to change that. The company is betting that gains in machine learning and artificial intelligence can improve the accuracy of space weather forecasting while also providing near-real time updates. The company was founded by Padmashri Suresh, an engineer who cut her teeth on sounding rocket and cubesat missions at Utah State University before embarking on a NASA-sponsored PhD on space weather and machine learning. There, she saw firsthand how inaccurate information on space weather can affect launch, satellite operations, and instrument performance. After leaving the university, she moved into the tech industry, though she says she was waiting for the right time to build a space weather company. “Fast forward to 2022, SpaceX lost close to, I think, 38 or 40 satellites, where space weather was a driver,” she said. “I thought perhaps this was that critical mass that spurred me into action to build this company.”Space weather was back in the news last year, when a far stronger than predicted solar maximum had catastrophic consequences for some satellite operators. NASA and NOAA collect space weather data using satellites data and radar and magnetometers on the ground, generating its predictions using bulky, fundamental physics-based models, some of which must be run on supercomputers. But even given this legacy competition, Suresh admits that “it’s a hard problem” to solve. “You’re looking at physics at so many different scales,” she said. “You first need to understand the sun. You then need to understand this environment from the Sun to the Earth. There are so many drivers that are really impacting the overall space weather that we experience.” But she says that we can extract more signals from data using AI, thanks to increasing access to high performance computing, and advances in prediction algorithms. There’s also simply more data, due to a greater number of satellites in low Earth orbit. Investors including Panache Ventures, Metaplanet, 7Percent Ventures, Mythos Ventures and AIN Ventures are contributing $2.8 million to the efforts. Suresh said the capital would be used to accelerate product development from a bench-scale product to a fully fledged service for any launch provider or satellite operator in any orbit by next year. Most of the funding will go toward expanding the team from today’s 5 employees to 10 over the next year. Perceptive already has a pilot program and a few early signups, customers that are providing early feedback, and the company aims to onboard more people to that program. Once the commercial product is live, customers will be able to sign up for a subscription that provides short- and long-term forecasting at different pricing tiers, based on the number of assets, the orbit, and other factors. Thinking even longer-term, Suresh said that accurate space weather data will be essential for scaling the number of satellites in low Earth orbit or having a sustained human presence in space. She pointed out that the International Space Station mission controllers use space weather as an input to determine when it is safe for astronauts to perform spacewalks or when it is safe for companies like SpaceX to launch them to and from Earth. Even aviation companies use space weather to understand how much radiation exposure pilots are receiving. “There’s a human factor,” she said.

H3X is changing the game with electric motors so compact and efficient that the aerospace and marine world — not to mention investors — are taking notice.We covered H3X’s launch from stealth back in 2021; since then, CEO Jason Sylvestre exclusively told TechCrunch that H3X has “mainly been showing that this tech works, and we’ve gotten orders from a lot of aerospace companies to prove it.” They’ve also grown from the founding team (Sylvestre, CTO Max Liben, and COO Eric Maciolek) to a still lean 33 people — “maybe leaner than we should be.”H3X makes electric motors, which, to be clear, does not mean full powertrains like the battery-motor-wheels combo you see in an electric car or the propeller mechanism in a plane. It’s the middle part of the equation, turning electricity into mechanical force, usually a spinning driveshaft.What sets the company’s gear apart, though it may sound prosaic, is simply how small they are for how much power they put out. Electric motors are generally smaller and simpler than internal combustion engines. But they still need to have room for all the wiring, cooling and other components of the system, especially when they need to drive something as big as a vehicle.As a very rough comparison, if you were using an electric motor the size of a dishwasher, the H3X equivalent — same power, same torque, etc. — might be the size of a microwave. That’s a tremendous change in industries where every inch and pound counts, like drones and small aircraft.Sylvestre said that although their series of smaller motors (think hundreds of kilowatts) have been popular and useful, a new $20 million funding round will allow the team to complete development of their megawatt-scale motors, which they hope will change the game completely.A mockup of the megawatt unit, and H3X’s test facility.Image Credits: H3X“We think we’re going to come in and establish a new market-leading product that will transform the aerospace and marine industries,” he told TechCrunch. “It should be a pretty stark contrast: megawatt machines would take up this whole room [i.e., an ordinary small meeting room]; ours is about two feet in diameter and about one foot thick.”For those of you without an innate sense of how many watts are needed to do things, a megawatt motor would be able to run something on the scale of a small passenger aircraft. And that’s just where the company is seeing traction.“We’ve seen a ton of interest in hybrid electric aircraft because you get to realize the benefits of electric propulsion, but without the drawbacks and limitations of batteries,” Sylvestre said.Hybrid architectures have been demonstrated at a smaller scale (like a two-seater or seaplane), but with what’s out there, the math just doesn’t work out for anything larger.A test aircraft using an H3X motor.Image Credits: H3XFortunately, H3X’s motors seem tailor-made for this application (and indeed in a sense can be said to be so).First, the design is reversible, meaning it can seamlessly act as a motor or a generator, or both. This simplifies hybrid powertrains, in which a combustion engine drives a generator, and in turn powers an electric motor, which drives propulsion. That may sound unnecessarily complicated, but it allows both engine and motor to run at peak efficiency with minimal loss; many ships already run on diesel-electric hybrid engines. The gains would be compounded with two H3X units in series.Second, because the units are small and the power electronics are built in, you can just add as many as you need to scale up.“If you were to use a traditional megawatt class generator, as they exist today, that aircraft would have a tough time getting off the ground. And if it did, it wouldn’t fly very far,” he continued. “We’ve got two customers in commercial aviation; one is working on a 19-seat aircraft, the other on a 30-seat aircraft. But these units are stackable, so to get to higher power levels you just stack them up: you could power a 50-seat or 100-seat aircraft.”They have contracts and customers across aerospace, marine and the military to power things like drones and small aircraft, some kind of marine racing setup (whatever that means) “and one classified one where they actually can’t tell us what it is.” (Fortunately, the tech doesn’t seem well suited for weapons development, though in a press release, investor Cubit Capital’s Philip Carson said the company has “strong traction today at the Department of Defense.”)Image Credits: H3xThe marine side is another promising growth area, with much of the industry pushing to decarbonize or at least minimize reliance on the aging diesel engines that power so much of shipping and passenger traffic on the water. But the power involved is tremendous, and space on board is limited — so low volume and high output are music to the industry’s ears.Even heavy industry, which uses generators to power some facilities or equipment, is interested. Why, when they have as much space as they need? Sylvestre said a stack of H3X units may well be simpler and easier to maintain than a traditional setup, not to mention it involves hauling a lot less metal around.Though the company’s megawatt dreams have yet to be realized, H3X is already generating revenue. Sylvestre declined to get too specific but said it was “in the millions” last year, on track to 5x this year, with an aim of profitability in 2026.The $20 million A round will enable the company to hire up and build out the facilities necessary to finish the megawatt units and complete their existing contracts. There’s still plenty of demand for the kilowatt-scale motors, but the megawatts are the ones that could crack open new markets.The funding round was led by Infinite Capital, with participation from Hanwha AM, Cubit Capital, Origin Ventures, Industrious Ventures, Venn10 Capital, as well as existing investors Lockheed Martin Ventures, Metaplanet, Liquid 2 Ventures and TechNexus.If electrification really is the next phase of shipping and local/regional air travel, it’s going to be hard to match what H3X is putting out there. But startups like this are increasingly drivers of change in legacy industries, and there’s plenty of room for everyone up there.

The loss was nearly $300 million worse than the second quarter last year.As a result, Rivian’s balance of cash and cash equivalents was $5.76 billion at the end of the quarter. That includes the first $1 billion from VW. This all comes as Rivian has begun shipping revamped versions of the R1 that are simpler and cheaper to make. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe has said these vehicles, shipped at scale, should help the company reach positive gross profit by the end of 2024. But since Rivian is expecting to make and sell roughly the same number of EVs this year as it did in 2023, all eyes are on its second model — the R2 SUV, due out in 2026 — to help establish it as a sustainable company. Until then, Rivian will be helped by the additional $4 billion that VW will pour into the young automaker — as long as the two companies finalize the agreement. That is supposed to happen sometime in the fourth quarter of this year. Once complete, the deal will see Rivian and VW create a joint venture that will leverage Rivian’s advanced electrical architecture and software. That technology will flow into Rivian’s R2 and the many VW Group’s EVs, and possibly ones built by other automakers.Rivian will also turn to other methods to pad out its business. For instance, the company said Tuesday that it sold $17 million worth of regulatory credits to other companies in the second quarter. The company is also building out an EV charging network to support its vehicles that could pull in some extra revenue.

Even orgs with data analytics teams often struggle to make effective use of their data. According to a recent Gartner survey, fewer than half of data and analytics leaders say their teams are effective in providing value to their organizations.German computer scientist Michael Berthold became aware of the issue while a professor at University of Konstanz, where he consulted with a number of businesses trying to adopt data analytics practices. These businesses frequently expressed a desire for a platform that could help process and analyze their data, Berthold told TechCrunch — and so he and several colleagues set out to build one.“The initial goal was to create a modular, highly scalable and open data processing platform that allowed for the easy integration of different data loading, processing, transformation, analysis and visual exploration modules, without focus on any particular application area,” Berthold said. “The software was designed to be professional-grade and also serve as an integration platform for various other data analysis projects.”The resulting open source platform, called KNIME, eventually morphed into a VC-backed startup of the same name, and the aforementioned colleagues (Bernd Wiswedel and Thomas Gabriel) joined Berthold on the founding team.Today, KNIME has 400 customers paying for the fully managed version of its platform, including Audi, AMD, Lilly, Novartis, Bayer, Sanofi, Genentech, the FDA, P&G and Mercedes-Benz. Annual recurring revenue has been increasing 30-40% per year since KNIME’s founding in 2008, according to Berthold, and now sits at about €30 million ($~32.35 million).A look at KNIME’s workflow orchestration dashboard.Image Credits: KNIMEKNIME’s software is built on visual, no-code workflows designed to integrate with an org’s systems of record. Users can tap KNIME to build pipelines to transform data, turn data into reports and visualizations, or compare one set of data to another, regardless of where the data resides.Through KNIME’s business hub, companies can run automate, and deploy data workflows with optional governance and security capabilities on top. The hub is also where they can build internal libraries of workflows so that teams can share and edit workflows as needed, or install workflows created by the wider KNIME community.KNIME charges a pretty penny for its services — annual licenses start at $39,900 for the business hub. But customers seem willing to pay for them, which has gotten investors’ attention. This week, KNIME announced that Invus invested $30 million in its business to bring KNIME’s total raised to $50 million. The proceeds will be put toward product development, expanding KNIME’s team from 250 people today to 275 by the end of the year, and customer acquisition efforts across the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Berthold said.Asked how KNIME plans to remain competitive against data analytics rivals like Dataiku, Alteryx, IBM and SAS, Berthold pointed to capabilities like KNIME’s recently launched AI assistant, which helps users get started or add advanced functionality to existing data projects. KNIME also plans to grow its portfolio of software-as-a-service offerings, Berthold said, targeting small- and medium-sized businesses with pay-as-you-go tiers.“KNIME was close to profitability in 2024, but with the added investment, we’ve chosen to invest more and grow in the coming years,” Berthold said. “We’ve seen a slowdown in tech, mostly resulting in longer sales cycles and more difficult negotiations. In some cases, budgets were put on hold, but the open source analytics platform adoption has continued, positioning KNIME well for the future.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsAI, data analytics, Funding, Fundraising, KNIME, Startups, Startups \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46 billion in Q2 as it drives towards a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t48 mins agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost efficient versions — a sign… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t60 mins agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

Meet Google TV StreamerBrian Heater8:35 AM PDT • August 6, 2024CommentImage Credits: GoogleAlong with a long-awaited update to the Nest Learning Thermostat, Google on Tuesday unveiled its latest set-top streaming box ahead of the company’s Made by Google 2024 event next week. Google TV Streamer’s arrival marks the end of the Chromecast line. With more than 100 million sold over an 11-year life, it was a good run.Along with a new, more straightforward name, the line is getting additional functionality warranting a redesign. Whereas the Chromecast plugged directly into the back of a TV via HDMI, Google TV Streamer is larger, designed to sit on top of an entertainment console below the set.The $100 device doubles as a smart home hub, as part of Google’s bid to revive excitement around the Nest line. The new functionality allows users to more directly control both Google Home and Matter-enabled accessories. You can think of it as a large-screen Nest Display or Pixel Tablet.The additional functionality requires an additional radio, which, in turn, requires a larger design. Attempting to pack all of that into a dongle on the back of a set would likely be a recipe for disaster.Along with Matter support, the system features a built-in Thread border router for improved connectivity with home devices. The addition of a Google Home panel to the UI makes it possible to check Nest cameras remotely (no third-party cameras yet) and adjust the temperature, along with various other Matter-enabled smart home device functions.As with the new Thermostat, Gemini is the big driver here. Unlike Pixel and Android, the Home line isn’t making the jump from Assistant, however. Rather, the models built in-house will be used to power this latest version. Along with conversational capabilities, Gemini will be used to curate the TV experience.“To make it easier to find what to watch, Google TV Streamer uses Google AI and your preferences to curate content suggestions across all of your subscriptions, organized conveniently in one place,” Google says in a post. “You can even build watchlists with recommendations for every member of your home.”Gemini will also be used to summarize reviews and even seasons of TV; in that sense, it will fill a role similar to the one it has been playing in Search over the past year. Like Chromecast, the system supports 4K playback. Inside, the company has upgraded the processor and bumped up memory to 32GB for faster performance.The system includes a devoted remote with devoted buttons for Netflix and the Google Home panel. There’s also a button built directly into the TV Streamer that will send out a chime from the remote when it inevitably gets lost.Google TV Streamer is up for preorder starting Tuesday, but won’t actually ship until September 26.

You can use DuckDuckGo for search, for example, Brave to browse the web and Proton Mail for webmail to name a few of the non-Google options for key digital tools out there. There’s even a web beta of Apple Maps these days. Or — hey — why not switch straight to the community mapping open data project OpenStreetMap? All of these are also services that can be accessed for free, too.What would be different in a web without Google is absolutely much bigger than mere utility. The real issue here is about the business model underpinning service delivery. And the opportunity, if we can imagine for a minute a web that’s not dominated by Google, for different models of service delivery — ones that prioritize the interests of web users and the public infosphere — to achieve scale and thrive.Such alternatives do already exist, as the list above shows. But on a web dominated by Google’s model of tracking-based advertising it’s extremely hard for pro-user approaches to thrive. That’s the real harm flowing from Google’s monopoly.Google likes to paint its company “mission” as “organizing the world’s information and making it universally accessible and useful,” as its marketing puts it. But this grandiose claim has always been a fig-leaf atop a business model that makes vast amounts of money by organizing data — most especially information about people — so it can make money from microtargeted advertising.Tracking web users’ activity feeds Google’s ability to profile the online population and profit from services related to selling highly targeted advertising. And it makes truly staggering amounts of money from this business: Alphabet, the brand Google devised almost a decade ago to pop a corporate wrapper around Google, reported full-year revenue of $307.39 billion for 2023. The vast majority of which is earned from ads.Whether from pay-per-click ads displayed on Google search or YouTube; or through ads Google displays elsewhere on publishers’ websites; or other programmatic ad services it offers, including via its AdX exchange; or its mobile advertising platform for app developers; or through Google’s ad campaign management, marketing and analytics tools, that’s all revenue flowing to Google.The simple truth is Google is making your information “useful” so it can feed Google’s bottom line because it’s in the advertising business. Put another way, its “mission” is chain-linked to a business model that’s based on tracking and profiling web users. Organizing the world’s information doesn’t sound so benign now does it?Consider how Google’s incentives to structure data to mesh with its commercial priorities extend to making user-hostile changes to how it displays information. See, for example, endless dark pattern design tricks it’s used to make it harder for users of Google Search to distinguish between organic search results and ads. Every confused user clicking an ad thinking it’s genuine information drives Google’s revenue engine. Useful to Google, obviously, but frustrating (at best) to web users trying to find a particular piece of information (tl;dr: your time being wasted is precious to Google’s profits).Consider, also, a more recent example: Just last month Google was accused by Italy’s competition and consumer watchdog of “misleading and aggressive” commercial practices. Including providing users with “inadequate, incomplete and misleading information” (emphasis ours) about decisions they should be able to exercise — thanks to a variety of EU laws — over the company’s ability to track and profile them by denying its ability to link their activity across different Google-owned accounts.Organizing this type of “information” — about the legal rights European users have to choose not to be tracked and profiled for Google’s profit — and making this info about how you can avoid being tracked “universally accessible and useful” does not appear to be a priority for Google, the adtech giant. Quite the opposite: Google stands accused of impeding users’ legal right to information that could help them protect themselves from Google’s surveillance. Oh.Google’s market powerGoogle’s market power is linked to its ownership of so much information about user intention which flows from its dominance of online search. Its market share of search in Europe is consistently above 90%. In the U.S., Google tends to hold a slightly lower but still dominant share. And — critically — on mobile it’s been able to ensure its search engine (or, from an ads perspective, its user intention data funnel) remains the default on Apple’s rival mobile platform because it pays the iPhone maker billions for the placement every year.A New York Times report last fall suggested Google pays Apple $18 billion a year. During the antitrust trial Google also disclosed it shares a whopping 36% — more than a third! — of search ad revenue from Safari with Apple.This is a core grievance of the U.S. antitrust ruling finding Google operates an illegal monopoly, as we reported earlier. By paying Apple to be the default search on iOS, the judge decided Google had blocked competitors from being able to build up their own search engines to a scale that would enable them to access enough data and reach to compete with Google Search.Such placement is important to Google because Apple’s iOS holds a dominant share of the mobile device market in the U.S. versus Google’s own Android platform (where Google typically gets to set all its own services as the default). Add to that, iOS users are generally more valuable targets for advertisers — so being able to keep accessing information about iPhone users’ intentions is strategically important to Google’s ad business.No surprise, then, that Google is willing to fork over such a major chunk of revenue to Apple so it can keep squatting on iOS as the default search choice. But buying this spot is also about shielding its tracking-based business model. Because Google pays Apple so much, Apple has little incentive to develop its own search engine to rival Google’s — meaning web users have missed out on the chance to try a web search product made in Cupertino. Given Apple puts such a premium on marketing privacy as a core brand value, you could at least imagine an Apple-designed search engine would do things differently and wouldn’t have to concern itself with perpetuating the mass tracking and profiling of web users as Google Search does.It’s true Apple does have an advertising business of its own. But the device maker is not, as Google is, also the owner and operator of core adtech infrastructure that’s been used to bake tracking and profiling into the mainstream web for decades. Add to that, if other search engines had the chance to gain more users because Google didn’t own the default iOS placement, there would be an opportunity for pro-privacy competitors, such as DuckDuckGo, to get in front of more humans and build greater momentum for alternative non-tracking-based business models.Instead, we have a web that’s locked to tracking as the default because it’s in Google’s business interests. Google’s ownership of Chrome gives it another key piece of infrastructure. Google’s browser holds a majority share of the market worldwide (currently around 65% per Statista). Its Chromium browser engine also underpins multiple rival browsers — such as Microsoft’s Edge browser, for example — meaning even lots of rival browsers to Google’s Chrome still use an engine that’s developed by Google. And the decisions it makes about browser infrastructure determine the business models that can fly.In recent years, Google has been working on reformulating its adtech stack under a project it dubbed “Privacy Sandbox.” The effort is intended to shift the current adtech model that Chrome supports from cookie-based microtargeting of web users, so individual-level tracking and profiling, to a new form of browser-level interest-based targeting that Google claims would be less bad for privacy.We can debate whether Privacy Sandbox would actually be a positive evolution of the tracking ads business model — the technical solution Google has devised may, technically, be less harmful to individual privacy, if it ends the mass insecure sharing of data about web users that currently takes place via real-time programmatic ad auctions. But the alternative infrastructure it’s devised is still designed to allow targeted manipulation of web users at scale — just based on organizing browser users’ into interest-based buckets for targeting. Regardless, one thing is crystal clear: It’s Google’s dominance that’s driving decisions about the future of web business models.Other mainstream browsers have already blocked tracking cookies. Google hasn’t, as yet, not only because of its commercial interests over the years but because its browser is also dominant. Which means all sorts of other players (publishers, advertisers, smaller adtechs etc.) are attached to the tracking data flows involved — dependent on Google’s infrastructure continuing to allow this spice through. This is why Google’s Privacy Sandbox has been closely supervised by regulators in Europe.Principally, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stepped in. In early 2022, it accepted a series of commitments on how Google would undertake the planned migration from tracking-cookie-based adtech to the reformulated interest-based targeting alternative, following complaints that the end of support for tracking cookies would be harmful to online publishers and advertisers reliant on the tracking ads business model.What’s happened as a result of this close regulatory scrutiny led by a competition authority? Google’s timeline to deprecate cookies got delayed. And then, just last month, it announced it was abandoning the move — saying it was instead proposing that regulators accept an alternative whereby Chrome users would be shown some form of a choice screen. (Presumably this would let them decide whether to accept cookie-based tracking or choose Google’s interest-based alternative but Google hasn’t shared further details yet.)Google’s self-interested approach to displaying information might be one reason not to trust the design of any such consent pop-up it devised. But the wider point here is that Google’s dominance of web infrastructure is so trenchant — the company’s model is so utterly baked into the mainstream web — that even Google can’t just make a change which might allow web users to get slightly more privacy. Because in flicking such levers the knock-on impact on other businesses that are dependent on its adtech infrastructure risks being a competition harm in itself.An alternative approachIf there’s ever a definition of a company that got too big — so big it basically owns and operates the web — then surely it’s Google.We can dream what a web without Google would look like. But it’s not easy to imagine, given how thoroughly it’s ingrained in web infrastructure. Not so much Mountain View as the whole mountain. Writing in the wake of the Google antitrust decision, Matt Stoller, author of the antitrust-focused newsletter Big, has a go at imagining a post-Google web in the latest edition of his publication. “I think there’s a vision tucked in an April speech by Federal Trade Commission consumer protection chief Sam Levine on how the internet didn’t have to become the cesspool that it is today,” Stoller writes. “He sketched out what the internet could become if well-regulated, a place where we have zones of privacy, where not everything operates like a casino, and where AI works for us. This [Google antitrust] case brings us a step closer to Levine’s vision, because it means that people who want to build better safer products now have the chance to compete.”I think you can also see glimpses of the better web that’s possible in some of the great alternative products of our age. The private messaging provided by Signal, for example. Or the strongly encrypted email, calendar, collaborative documents and other privacy-safe productivity tools being developed by Proton. Though it’s notable that both have had to be structured as nonprofit foundations in a bid to ensure they can keep providing free access to pro-user products that don’t generate revenue by data-mining their users.In an age of monopoly power driving wall-to-wall digital surveillance that unpleasant reality remains the mainstream web rule.“I believe our digital economy can get better,” wrote Levine. “Not because our tech giants will voluntarily change their ways, or because markets will magically fix themselves. But because, at long last, there is momentum across government — state and federal, Republicans and Democrats — to push back against unchecked surveillance.”The decision Monday by Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to find Google a monopolist could be the first brick ripped out of the surveillance wall. If Google’s appeal fails, and remedies are imposed — just imagine! — a corporate break-up that forces the fig-leaf Alphabet to divest key Google infrastructure. Such an outcome could finally upend Google’s decades-long grip on web data flows and reboot the default model, setting this place free for users, startups and communities to reimagine and rebuild anew.

The idea behind the update is to help you make more informed decisions about your travel plans by giving you information that airlines typically won’t. For instance, an airline may delay your travel by half an hour, then an hour, and so on. Flighty, on the other hand, can tell you in advance that your flight will likely have a five-hour delay due to things like an official ground stop at your airport or weather issues. With this information, you can choose to do things like rebook your flight or wait a bit longer before heading out to the airport.Flighty now monitors every trackable delay reason, including late-arriving airplanes, air traffic control notices, airport operational issues and events like the Super Bowl, to keep you informed about your travel. Once the app analyzes the data, it gives you clear notifications. You may see a notification that reads: “Delayed 45m. Due to late arriving aircraft from New York.” Image Credits: FlightyAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation, late inbound airplanes are responsible for up to 35% of all delays. Flighty 4.0 uses machine learning to predict these delays up to six hours before airlines acknowledge them. The company says its predictions are over 95% accurate. Air traffic control is the second most common reason for delays, which includes factors like waiting for a storm to pass or spacing out flights to prevent taxiway congestion. Flighty now taps into air traffic control data, deciphers it for your specific flight and then tells you how delays will impact you.The latest version of the app also includes live airport performance trends, because in some cases it’s not your plane that’s the problem, it’s your entire airport. For these situations, the app now features live performance of takeoffs and landings at your airports, so you can ensure your airport is operating normally. Flighty 4.0 is available today on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Mac. The new features are available with a Flighty Pro subscription, which costs $4 for one week or $48 for a year. Launched in 2019, Flighty boasts millions of users and received a 2023 Apple Design Award. Flighty serves as both a flight companion and a travel log, as it lets you add your past and future flights to the app using flight numbers and booking references from your email, calendar, TripIt or manually.

It’s a classic case of supply not meeting demand. Michael Rigney thinks he can predict when a household will need more hot water, eliminating cold showers without turning to expensive alternatives like on-demand water heaters.Rigney’s quest started a few years ago when he began researching water heating. What he saw “was really eye opening,” Rigney told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The basic technology behind most water heaters, whether they’re gas or electric, hasn’t changed much in several decades. They might be cheap to buy, but they’re not cheap to run.Heat pump water heaters have started to change that for many homeowners, improving efficiency and lowering utility bills. But even there, “I saw a tremendous opportunity for improvement,” Rigney said. He founded Cala Systems in Boston in 2020 as heat pump water heaters were beginning to take off. Because of that shift, he said, “there was an entrepreneurial opportunity to build the best heat pump water heater.”Water heaters tend to be fairly straightforward appliances: At their core, they have three basic parts: an insulated tank, a heating element and a thermostat. Most people set the temperature once and forget it; on rare occasions, they might set it a bit higher when overnight guests arrive. As hot water is drawn from the tank, cold water replaces it, driving down the temperature inside. When the temp gets low enough, the thermostat tells the heater to turn on.“That’s really antiquated,” Rigney said. “We can do better in 2024.”Cala Systems’ first product will be a 65-gallon heat pump water heater.Image Credits: Cala SystemsCala Systems’ water heater pairs an advanced heat pump with an AI-powered control system to forecast hot water demand and heat the water in the tank accordingly. The company gathers general information like weather forecasts and time-of-use energy pricing and sends it to the water heater. That data is then analyzed on the device along with household-specific information, including water usage patterns, incoming cold water temperature and whether the home has solar panels. (Rigney said the company will never sell household data.)By analyzing water use patterns, the tank can anticipate when there will be a surge in demand and heat the water in the most efficient way possible.For example, if the weather is predicting a handful of sunny days before a couple days of clouds, Cala’s algorithms might decide to use daytime power from a homeowner’s solar panels to overheat the tank. Then, when hot water is called for, it mixes it with cold water to cool down to the appropriate temperature. That allows the water heater to make the most of excess solar production, essentially turning the tank into a battery that stores energy for a cloudy day.In other instances, when both weather and water demand are consistent, Cala’s water heater can slow down the speed of the compressor, lengthening the time it takes to heat the tank for an efficiency bump. “In water heating, when you slow down the compressor, you increase the efficiency of heat transfer by about 30%.” Rigney said. “It’s a pretty significant impact.”And if there are house guests coming? Cala included a boost mode that people can activate on the tank or in an app.Today, water heaters in the U.S. are split almost evenly between natural gas and electric resistance, with oil, propane and heat pumps rounding things out. Water heating is responsible for around 20% of the typical American household’s energy usage, and heat pump water heaters slash that significantly while also cutting people’s dependence on natural gas.Heat pump water heaters may only make up a few percent of the market, but they are rapidly growing in share, helped in part by incentives within the Inflation Reduction Act. And while they’re more expensive to install up front, they’re cheaper in the long run because they’re more efficient to operate, leading to lower household carbon emissions.Rigney said that Cala will be buying parts from various suppliers and assembling the final product in the U.S. (“This is not a product that ships well,” he said with a laugh.) The company’s first product, a 65-gallon model, will cost $2,850; it’s available to preorder with delivery sometime early next year. That’s about $800 more than competitors, though Rigney said that lower utility bills should eliminate that difference over time.To support the rollout, Cala exclusively told TechCrunch that it has raised a $5.6 million seed round led by the Clean Energy Venture Group and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, with Burnt Island Ventures, CapeVista Capital and Leap Forward Ventures participating. With so few heat pump water heaters sold to date, “this is a category that is truly nascent,” Rigney said. “We think there’s an opportunity here to redefine what people expect a water heater to do.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsAI, Cala Systems, Clean Energy Venture Group, Climate, energy efficiency, Exclusive, heat pumps, machine learning, Startups, water heater \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46B in Q2 as it drives toward a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t1 hour agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost-efficient versions — a sign of… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t1 hour agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

The system is — as its name helpfully suggests — the successor to the Figure 01 robot unveiled in 2023. An initial teaser video is similar to those we’ve seen from other humanoids, echoing consumer electronics product videos, rather than a raw demo of the robot in action.Another video released Tuesday showcases the robot’s slow, bent-leg gait across the floor of what looks to be the demo area constructed in the middle of Figure’s offices. Another two robots appear in the background, carting totes — the biggest out-of-the-box application for most of these humanoids.Image Credits: FigureThe most notable addition this time out arrives by way of a longstanding partnership with OpenAI, which helped Figure raise a $675 million Series B back in February, valuing the South Bay firm at $2.6 billion.The mainstream explosion of neural networks has been enticing for the robotics industry at large, but humanoid developers have taken a particular interest in the technology. One of the form factor’s key selling points is its ability to effectively slot alongside human co-workers on a factory floor — once the proper safety measures are in place, of course. Figure 02 is outfitted with speakers and microphones to speak and listen to people at work.Image Credits: FigureModels like ChatGPT and Google Gemini have been prized for their natural language capabilities, ushering in a new area of smart assistants and chatbots. Outfitting these systems with such capabilities is a no-brainer: Doing so helps humans instruct the robots, while at the same time adding a level of transparency to what the robot is doing at any given time.Communication like this is doubly important when dealing with humanoid robots, as the systems are designed to wander freely without a safety cage. Despite their human-like design, it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that they’re still big, heavy and potentially dangerous pieces of moving metal. Combined with vision and proximity sensors, speech can be an important safety tool.Figure certainly isn’t alone in this work. Late last year, Agility showcased the work it’s been doing to leverage generative AI for improved human-robot communication. The use of neural networks was a key focus for Google’s Everyday Robots team before it was shuttered. Elon Musk, meanwhile, is ostensibly in charge of both Grok AI and Optimus — two projects that will no doubt dovetail sooner rather than later.For its part, OpenAI has hedged its bets a bit in the category. Prior to its Figure investment, the firm backed Norwegian firm 1X. Over the past year, however, Figure has become far buzzier in the industry. Its aforementioned Series B also included other top tech names like Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Intel Capital.Image Credits: FigureFigure recently began pilots with BMW. In June, the company debuted a video showcasing an earlier, tethered version of the robot autonomously performing tasks on the floor, with the help of neural networks.The company notes that the 02 robot has already paid a visit to the automaker’s Spartanburg, South Carolina, facility for training and data collection purposes. We’re still very much in the early stages of these partnerships. Agility, Apptronik and Sanctuary AI have announced similar pilots with carmakers. Working on Teslas has been a key focus for Optimus since before it was Optimus, and Boston Dynamics-owner Hyundai has its sights set on humanoids in its own factories.Communication is one piece of what Figure is referring to as a “ground-up hardware and software redesign” between 01 and 02. The list also includes six RGB cameras, coupled with an onboard visual language model, improved CPU/GPU computing and improved hands, with 16 degrees of freedom.Hands have been their own hot-button topic in the humanoid robot world. There are differing opinions regarding how closely designers should hew to their human counterparts.There’s a lot to be said for the nimbleness and dexterity of our appendages, though human-inspired hands have been criticized for their delicacy and a perceived over engineering. Figure, for its part, has been dedicated to using humanlike hands as its system’s end effectors.We don’t have a timeline for a wider Figure 02 rollout, though the company is hinting at a broader future outside the warehouse/factory floor. “Figure’s robot combines the dexterity of the human form with advanced AI to perform a wide range of tasks across commercial applications and, in the near future, the home,” the company writes.

One post includes a photo of a pile of iPads on a desk in one Singaporean school’s IT department that have to be set up as a result of the Mobile Guardian cyberattack, according to the poster.  Mobile Guardian is said to have more than 2,500 schools in over 50 countries worldwide as customers, according to a Singaporean government report from May responding to an earlier cybersecurity incident.TechCrunch sent several questions to Mobile Guardian chief executive Patrick Lawson about the incident, including whether the company has received any communication from the apparent threat actor, and if the company has reported the incident to the U.K. data protection watchdog, the ICO. We also asked who, if anyone, at Mobile Guardian is responsible for cybersecurity.Lawson fixed a typo in the company’s statement that we pointed out in our email requesting comment, but did not respond to our multiple inquiries.Do you know more about the Mobile Guardian cyberattack?

That is a 3x and 5x improvement, respectively, over the previous campaign. The next flight campaign, scheduled for mid-September, will attempt supersonic flight. Mk-II is acknowledged as a development vehicle, paving the way for a two-stage-to-orbit aircraft called Mk-III. But it’s easy to imagine the demand for a vehicle with the kind of capabilities Dawn aims to bring to Mk-IIB, as it calls the next supersonic iteration.The company outlined some of those goals in a blog post published Tuesday: “By the end of 2025, we’re looking to climb faster than an F-15, fly higher than a MiG-25, faster than an SR-71, and, ultimately, be the first vehicle to fly above the Kármán line; 100km altitude (the generally accepted definition of ‘space’), twice in a single day. Some of these records have stood for over 50 years.” The company sees two main development streams, or revenue opportunities. One, using a vehicle optimized for payload capacity, caters to remote sensing, Earth observation, and atmospheric research. The second, a vehicle optimized for high-speed atmospheric flight, would be for hypersonic testing, point-to-point transportation and microgravity research. “We’re looking at still relatively small vehicle designs that would be optimized for each of those applications,” Dawn co-founder and CEO Stefan Powell said in a recent interview. “We’re not talking publicly about exactly which ones we’re going after, when or how or whatnot, but the Mk-IIB can do a little bit of both, and so it’s allowing us to dip our toes into the commercial side of both aspects. So we’re pretty active in market now, talking to lots of customers who would be wanting to do one or these other things.”Dawn has raised at least $15 million in funding and has spent relatively little on the flight program so far, as such things go: just $10 million, with the overall aim of completing it for under $20 million total. The company generates some revenue from its other business line, small satellite propulsion systems, but it’s still a relatively small amount of outside capital, especially for an aerospace company at this stage of development.It’s a far cry from the development costs of comparable spaceplanes, hypersonic aircraft, or vertical rockets. Powell credits the company’s achievement on the fact that it decided to pursue, as it puts in the blog post, “an aircraft with the performance of a rocket, not a rocket with wings.” Rockets have high stakes: Each flight must be performed flawlessly. Even in development stages, when anomalies occur that can lead to a rocket’s destruction, it can be hard to survive — and actually iterate — without lots of cash to fall back on. Instead, the company looked to aviation. The company’s co-founder and CFO, James Powell, had worked on aircraft, and the company looked to that industry, with its low marginal operating costs, rapid reuse and high reliability to inform its plans.  “All of our development to date has really been about just developing this muscle of being able to learn quickly and apply this ‘it’s an aircraft with the performance of a rocket, not a rocket with wings’ mentality, because that allows just such a fundamentally better way to operate,” he said. “I think common knowledge is that spaceplanes have been tried with the Shuttle, and that didn’t work, and it’s a dumb idea. And if not that then, things with wings are stupid because, look at Virgin Orbit, that didn’t work. Air launch is dumb. You have to get to quite a nuanced conversation before you actually understand the difference between what we’re trying to do and the rockets with wings that have flown before us, and how the path we’re on is very much an aircraft path, but there is still a path to making it have the performance of a rocket.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsDawn Aerospace, Space, TC \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46B in Q2 as it drives toward a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t1 hour agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost-efficient versions — a sign of… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t1 hour agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that GrubMarket, the startup that has quietly built a B2B empire in produce and grocery logistics and is now valued at $3.5 billion, has acquired Good Eggs, a once-feted fresh food delivery startup that has fallen on hard times recently.The financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed, but sources with knowledge of the deal told TechCrunch that it was an all-stock transaction that valued Good Eggs slightly higher than its previous valuation of $22 million. The sources also said Good Eggs’ investors proactively approached GrubMarket looking for an exit.TechCrunch has also confirmed that Good Eggs will be run by a new leader under GrubMarket: Keith Brewer, who was the COO of GrubMarket-owned Daylight Foods, will head Good Eggs. While a number of Good Eggs’ staff are expected to come over to GrubMarket, it’s not yet clear whether Rodrigo Arévalo, the Uber alum who is currently listed as Good Eggs’ CEO, will be staying on.This is a pretty major turn for Good Eggs, and it serves as one more signal of how investors, who pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into perpetually loss-making startups, are now looking to draw a line under those activities and move on.Good Eggs, for context, was valued as high as $365 million in November 2020, per PitchBook data (a round it announced in 2021), and had a vaunted investor list that included Benchmark, Index, Sequoia and Thrive, among many others. But as the COVID-19 tailwinds faded, it hit the rocks and was eventually marked down a whopping 94% last year, landing it at that $22 million valuation.GrubMarket, meanwhile, is now valued at around $3.5 billion and has raised over $560 million in funding from various backers that include Tiger Global. Its $3.5 billion valuation was reported by CNBC earlier this year.GrubMarket initially competed with Good Eggs but eventually started supplying the startup. The changing nature of that relationship may well provide a window into why some companies succeed in the grocery logistics and delivery space and some do not.Good Eggs and GrubMarket launched in 2011 and 2014, respectively, with a focus on B2C, specifically delivering boxes of fresh food to consumers and businesses. But later, as Good Eggs kept its eyes on consumers, GrubMarket pivoted to concentrating on the B2B opportunity, and it scaled fast to work with smaller grocers as well as major ones.Whole Foods is GrubMarket’s biggest customer. It also supplies groceries and other items to major department stores like Walmart, as well as to other big names like Stanford University. With a pretty relentless eye on margins, unit economics, KPIs and long relationships with suppliers, GrubMarket has been profitable for some time.“Profitability is in our DNA,” GrubMarket CEO and founder Mike Xu said. “We know how to get things profitable. It’s a systematic approach.”Xu added that the company’s focus remains on B2B — it has made more than 80 acquisitions, most of which bolster that business — but acquisitions like Good Eggs underscore how it could use its economies of scale to revisit B2C. Still, Xu described the deal as “optimistic” rather than opportunistic.Grocery and food delivery startups have faced a lot of ups and downs, and some categories have been hit pretty hard. Getir, a major player in “instant” grocery delivery that aggressively raised hundreds of millions of dollars (from some of the same backers as Good Eggs, as it happens), earlier this year cut its losses and retreated to its home market of Turkey. Other startups are struggling to raise at strong valuations while a few like GrubMarket are playing consolidator to improve their cost structures. U.S.-based Instacart is due to announce its second-quarter results today, which could prove a bellwether for other companies in the space.

It usually involves a human tester creating a series of test cases, and then checking the software interface for bugs and other issues.On Tuesday, MuukTest, a Raleigh, North Carolina startup, announced a new AI agent designed to help build those tests in a much more automated fashion.“Since we started, the vision has been automating software QA technology to reduce test creation to a click, and that has been the whole vision,” company co-founder and CEO Ivan Barajas Vargas told TechCrunch.These tools enable testers to test every menu, button and operation in the software user interface under multiple conditions to try and catch as many bugs as possible before the software is released to the public.CTO and co-founder Renan Ugalde says that Barajas Vargas has been involved in software quality assurance testing for 20 years, and they wanted to use Ugalde’s engineering prowess to capture that deep understanding and train an AI agent to help build the test suites.They have combined a number of AI technologies to put that knowledge to work including multiple large language models, traditional machine learning, computer vision and image recognition. “We trained AI agents to think just like a QA tester, to understand the context within the application — understand what a menu is, what an input is, and when do you expect to see something,” Ugalde said.This requires reinforcement learning, as well as more information about the overall context and all the experience that the two founders have in QA to translate that into an agent.Over time, “AI agent” has emerged as a term for AI-fueled software that assists with a task or set of tasks, but to this point there is no standard definition. For MuukTest, it acts as an intelligent assistant, performing some of the more mundane tasks that a human QA tester would have traditionally done.The founders immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico in 2011. Barajas Vargas eventually settled in at Dell, while Ugalde landed at IBM, as both grew into their careers with increasing levels of responsibility. They joined forces and launched MuukTest in 2019, where the goal has always been to reduce the amount of effort required to generate and run QA tests.Early versions of their solution used no-code and algorithms to create the tests, but with the new generative AI product, customers can simply describe the kind of test suite they want and MuukTest creates it for them automatically. They can then run the set of tests created by the AI with a single click, greatly reducing the amount of effort required, he said.MuukTest really began to find product-market fit at the beginning of last year. Even before the AI element was added to the product set, the company was doing well with a 15x revenue increase last year over the prior year, and they think they are ready to grow even faster with the new capabilities.The company, which participated in Mass Challenge, a Massachusetts-based startup incubator, the year they launched the startup, has raised a total of $6 million between investments and grants. With 36 employees and 10 contractors, Barajas Vargas says the company intends to remain conservative when it comes to spending.The new AI agent capability is generally available starting today.

You can tap on a tag to see a list of related podcast episodes on the same topic. This allows you to find podcasts on specific topics like “Coffee” and “Dopamine” in addition to the usual categories like Comedy and News.Image Credits: AmazonThe company explained that the new feature is powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) but also relies on human labor. The AI analyzes podcast transcripts and descriptions to identify key topics, and then human team members determine the relevant tags to add to the episode page. The feature is available for all Amazon Music users in the U.S. on iOS and Android devices, starting today. It’ll roll out across top podcasts on Amazon Music, including The Daily, SmartLess, and This American Life, among others. The company also plans to expand the coverage of Topics to more podcast content, which will lead to a wider range of topics and an improved list of related podcast episodes. Another AI-powered feature that Amazon Music is adding is Maestro, an AI playlist generator that creates playlists based on user prompts. The feature launched in beta this past April. The new AI features follow Amazon’s acquisition of audio content discovery engine Snackable AI last year, which aimed to help enhance features for its podcasting venture.       More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsAI, amazon music, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Media & Entertainment, podcasts \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46B in Q2 as it drives toward a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t59 mins agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost-efficient versions — a sign of… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t1 hour agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

Businesses will initially have to use the company’s payment processing services, such as PayPal Braintree or PayPal Complete Payments, to use Fastlane.The company started testing Fastlane in January. It stores customer data such as names, email IDs, phone numbers, shipping addresses and payment details. When a customer is on a merchant’s website, Fastlane can pull all of this data without the customer having to log in. Users just need to enter a verification code they get via email to approve a purchase.PayPal said it relies on signals like a customer entering their phone number or email to fetch data from Fastlane. If a customer is not signed up for Fastlane, PayPal gives them an option to do so during the checkout.According to a study published by Capterra, which sells software for marketplaces, 43% of customers prefer checking out their shopping as a “guest” so that they don’t have to sign in to e-commerce websites. And, 72% of consumers said they choose guest checkout even if they have an account.Frank Keller, EVP of large enterprise and merchant platforms at PayPal, told TechCrunch over a call that Fastlane helps businesses with better conversion.“If you look at conversion rates of guest checkouts, they are fundamentally lower than merchants get with other methods because you need to fill in all your information. That’s why we built Fastlane to improve the speed of guest checkout, because speed wins sales,” Keller said.PayPal claims that during the Fastlane test, guest checkout conversions were around 80% and checkouts were 32% faster.PayPal Fastlane competes with other one-click solutions such as Stripe Link, Checkout.com, OurPass and Deuna. Keller added that the company plans to offer this service in other regions.

Schaben / Getty ImagesWaymo, the Alphabet-owned self-driving car company, is adding another 10 square miles to its robotaxi service area to include cities surrounding San Francisco. The move, which adds Daly City, Broadmoor and Colma, pushes its total commercial service territory to about 55 square miles. Waymo said Tuesday it is also adding 16 square miles of new robotaxi service area in Los Angeles, including Marina del Rey, Mar Vista, Playa Vista, and more of Hollywood, Chinatown and Westwood.Waymo has been pushing to add more territory and reach more customers in a bid to scale its commercial operations and eventually become profitable — although that goal is still out of reach. The ever-expanding service territories have helped Waymo reach several other milestones. The company said it has provided more than two million paid trips to riders across all Waymo One markets, which includes Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. The company said its fleet of commercial vehicles serves more than 50,000 paid trips each week across those same markets. While these operations generate revenue, Waymo’s operations are still supported by its backers. Its parent company, Alphabet, has been the primary source of capital, recently announcing it will invest another $5 billion into Waymo. Expanded service area in San Francisco.Image Credits: WaymoThis latest expansion comes several months after receiving approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to operate a commercial robotaxi service in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Peninsula and on San Francisco freeways. Waymo has been testing its self-driving vehicles in the greater SF Peninsula.Waymo has operated a commercial service 24 hours a day, seven days a week throughout the city of San Francisco since receiving approval from the commission in August 2023. The CPUC approved in March 2024 Waymo’s request to expand commercial operations into new territory. Waymo doesn’t provide detailed information on its global fleet. However, a spokesperson did tell TechCrunch that today there are about 300 vehicles in San Francisco, 50 in Los Angeles and 200 in Phoenix. The company also has a limited fleet that is testing in Austin. Other Waymo vehicles are still used for testing in Mountain View, California, and periodically in other areas. Waymo said demand has increased in Los Angeles and more than 150,000 people have signed up for the waitlist. Waymo removed the waitlist for San Francisco riders in June.

Users can “guide” the images they generate using reference images, edit existing visuals, remove backgrounds and generate variations of images, says Yun.“Titan Image Generator v2 can intelligently detect and segment multiple foreground objects,” Yun writes. “With the Titan Image Generator v2, you can generate color-conditioned images based on a color palette. [And] you can use the image conditioning feature to shape your creations.”Image Credits: AmazonTitan Image Generator v2 supports image conditioning, optionally taking in a reference image and focusing on specific visual characteristics in that image, like edges, object outlines and structural elements. The model can also be fine-tuned using reference images like a product or company logo, so that generated images maintain a consistent aesthetic. Image Credits: AmazonAWS continues to remain vague about which data, exactly, it uses to train its Titan Image Generator models. The company previously told TechCrunch only that it’s a combination of proprietary and licensed data. Few vendors readily reveal such information; they see training data as a competitive advantage and thus keep it and info relating to it a closely guarded secret. Training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive to reveal much.In lieu of transparency, AWS offers an indemnification policy that covers customers in the event a Titan model like Titan Image Generator v2 regurgitates (i.e. spits out a mirror copy of) a potentially copyrighted training example.In the company’s recent second-quarter earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he’s still “very bullish” on generative AI tech like AWS’ Titan models, despite signs of second-guessing from the enterprise and the mounting costs related to training, fine-tuning and serving models.“In the generative AI space, it’s going to get big fast,” he said, “and it’s largely all going to be built from the get-go in the cloud.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsAI, AI, Amazon, AWS, Enterprise, Fundraising, Generative AI, image generation, Titan Image Generator v2 \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46B in Q2 as it drives toward a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t1 hour agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost-efficient versions — a sign of… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t1 hour agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

But the company has chosen to highlight the success of its autonomous vehicle effort, likely to assuage investors concerned about incoming competition from Tesla, which aims to reveal its first robotaxi in October.Uber said in its second-quarter results statement that the number of trips performed by autonomous vehicles rose 6x from a year earlier — up from what the company didn’t say. And, the first thing Uber highlighted in its presentation deck was AVs in a section titled, “Autonomous Vehicle Spotlight.” It detailed how the ride-hail and delivery giant has the right utilization, consumer experience and go-to-market expertise to “drive the greatest value for AV partners.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly described Tesla’s future robotaxi network as having a similar business model to Uber and Airbnb, where Tesla owners could add their properly equipped vehicles to the carmaker’s own ridesharing app. In places where there aren’t enough people to share their cars, Tesla would provide a dedicated fleet of robotaxis. Uber noted in its investor deck that having a hybrid network of autonomous and human drivers “enables consistent, high-quality and reliable consumer experiences across all geographies, 24/7.” The company began partnering with Waymo, Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle subsidiary, in October 2023 to offer robotaxi rides in Phoenix. That progressed to autonomous deliveries in the city in April.  Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Tuesday’s earnings call that he’s confident Uber will be able to “acquire AV content…on a global basis.”“The fact is, this is not turning out to be a winner-take-all market,” continued Khosrowshahi. “Originally, I think that was the concept, and why Uber wanted to develop the technology itself.”Uber has had a checkered past with AV development, one that’s been tainted by trade secret theft allegations and a fatal accident. The company began its AV journey in 2015 with a strategic partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s National Robotics Center, which became Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG). A year later, Uber acquired a self-driving truck startup called Otto — a startup founded by one of Google’s star engineers, Anthony Levandowski, along with three other Google veterans — and then subsequently shuttered its trucking tech unit to focus on self-driving cars. Bringing Otto on board resulted in Waymo accusing Levandowski of stealing trade secrets, which were then used by Uber. The case ended in a settlement in 2018, and the following year, Uber spun out Uber ATG after closing $1 billion in funding from Toyota. In 2020, Uber sold off the subsidiary to autonomous vehicle startup Aurora Innovation.Now, Uber’s plan is firmly based in partnering with other AV companies, which is in line with the company’s broader asset-light business model. Khosrowshahi noted Tuesday that every OEM is investing in some sort of L2 or L3 technology (advanced driver assistance systems that can handle some automated driving tasks). He also said that Uber thinks there will be many AV providers as newer imitation learning technologies take hold and create a “new wave of AV” at a “substantially lower capital cost than was necessary historically.”“If there are many, many AV providers, the marketplace — and our marketplace is by far the largest global marketplace, from a mobility, delivery and then freight, as well — the marketplace will have a very, very strong position,” said Khosrowshahi.Uber did not share how many autonomous trips it has performed in the second quarter or over the past year, but its count doesn’t just fall to robotaxis.The company has also partnered with sidewalk delivery robot companies Serve Robotics and, more recently, Cartken to deliver food autonomously on the Uber Eats network. Uber is also counting autonomous freight shipments in the total AV trip count. The company partnered with AV trucking company Waabi in September 2023, and the two companies have been doing commercial pilots between Dallas and Houston with a driver behind the wheel for the last 11 months. More recently, Uber Freight signed a multiyear deal with Aurora Innovation, another AV trucking startup, that will see the latter’s autonomous driving tech being offered on the Uber Freight network through 2030.None of the companies with active Uber partnerships — Waymo, Waabi, Serve — responded immediately to provide comment. Uber said it would announce more details on its AV plans in the coming months. That could include its recent deal with BYD to bring 100,000 new EVs onto the platform in Latin America, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The tie-up will give drivers discounts on BYD vehicle purchases or rentals, and the two companies will also collaborate on “future BYD autonomous-capable vehicles” to be deployed on Uber’s platform. “BYD has committed to very, very significant investments in the AV space,” said Khosrowshahi on Tuesday’s earnings call. “And judging from what they have accomplished in the EV space, I would make a bet on them in AV, as well.”In June, BYD announced a $14 billion investment in autonomous vehicle technology.Investor response to Uber’s results has been positive. Uber’s shares were up 6% in premarket trading at the time of writing, and are climbing back to levels it traded on last Thursday, before the broader stock markets tumbled. Uber also reported better-than-expected gross bookings in Q2, which rose 19% to $39.95 billion, slightly higher than the $39.7 billion predicted by analysts. In adjusted terms, Uber recorded net profit of $1.57 billion, again ahead of the $1.5 billion that analysts projected. Uber also said quarterly operating profits hit a record. Uber forecast third-quarter bookings between $40.25 billion to $41.75 billion, and said it expected headwinds to the tune of $400 million due to the recent strengthening of the dollar compared to other currencies. This article has been updated to reflect comments Uber’s CEO Dara Khosrowshahi made during Tuesday’s earnings call, as well as more context about Uber’s history with autonomous vehicles.

The company on Tuesday announced the launch of the Nest Learning Thermostat 4, 13 years after the release of the original and nearly a decade after the Learning Thermostat 3 and ahead of the Made by Google 2024 event next week.Google hopes this release will usher in a new era for its smart home play. The last several years saw a marked slowdown from the company, leading many to believe the category was all but dead in the water. The Nest line’s stasis coincided with a period of relative quiet for Amazon’s Echo line.It’s no coincidence that the new Learning Thermostat arrives as Google is amping up work on its generative AI model, Gemini. While the system appears to replace Google Assistant on Pixel and other Android devices, the branding is sticking around for the smart home line — albeit powered by many of Google’s new LLM-based models.Gemini will effectively boost Assistant’s conversational capabilities. Generative AI is capable of powering the kinds of more natural language interactions Google and Amazon have been working for more than a decade to achieve.Google notes in a release, “We’re thrilled to unveil how we’re using Gemini models to make our devices smarter and simpler to use than ever, starting with cameras and home automation. We’re also using Gemini models to make Google Assistant much more natural and helpful on your Nest speakers and displays.”Image Credits: Google NestThe fourth-generation Learning Thermostat refines the line’s familiar design with thinner and sleeker hardware. The always-on display is more customizable, launching with a choice of four faces that offer up more contextual information once someone comes closer. Each features a combination of time, temperature and air quality.Google opted to keep touch functionality off the display, instead maintaining the familiar turning radial hardware. The screen itself is 60% larger than the gen 3’s, with an edge to edge design that finally ditches the thick black bezel.In addition to a more conversational Assistant, new AI models are being leveraged for what Google calls “micro-adjustments,” based on the user’s habits. That’s the whole “learning” part of the product name. The refinements also utilize outside temperature to determine adjustments, all in a bid to save on energy consumption.The $280 smart thermostat comes with an additional Temperature Sensor in-box. The pebble-like piece of hardware can be placed in any key spot in the home to give the system a better overall notion of average temperature. Additional sensors can be purchased at $40 apiece or $99 for a three-pack.The third-gen Learning Thermostat will remain on shelves until the stock is fully depleted. The more budget-focused Thermostat E, which is currently priced at $130, is staying put.Preorders open today for the new Nest Learning Thermostat. It hits shelves August 20.

Writing Tools, which lets you reformat or rewrite text using Apple’s AI models, is one of the new always-available services in this update. But the tool will show you a message notifying you that AI-generated suggestions might not be of the highest quality when tackling certain topics.You can call up Apple Intelligence pretty much anywhere across the system when you need to rejig text. However, when you try to rewrite a paragraph or a sentence that has swear words, including “s—” and “bastard,” you will see a warning saying, “Writing Tools was not designed to handle this type of content,” with a header text warning that the quality of rewriting may vary.Swear words are not the only things that trigger this warning. Mentions of drugs, killing, or murder will also bring up this warning.Image Credits: Apple/Screenshot by TechCrunchEven when Apple Intelligence shows the warning, it still offers suggestions for sentences when you use one of the words or phrases that it hasn’t been trained on. One time in testing, I replaced “sh—y” with “crappy” to make the warning go away, and the AI tool returned the exact same suggestion as before.We have asked Apple to provide more information on what topics the writing tools are not trained to give a suggestions on. We will update the story if we hear back from the company.Apple is likely avoiding any controversy by prohibiting the tackling of certain words, topics and tones when its AI is rewriting sentences. Apple Intelligence-powered writing tools are not geared to generate new content from scratch, anyway. However, Apple wants to warn people when AI is looking at these terms.It took Apple years to remove a block on swear words from the keyboard’s autocorrect suggestions. Last year, with iOS 17, Apple finally rolled out an autocorrect feature that learns your swears. Perhaps with Apple Intelligence, Apple is just being cautious to prevent regulators from blaming it for generating problematic content.

Owji, who made the discovery yesterday, told TechCrunch that he found references for new payment features, such as “transactions, balance, and transfer.”BREAKING: X Payments is coming soon! pic.twitter.com/8JBIHjHOls— Nima Owji (@nima_owji) August 5, 2024When Musk initially acquired the social networking app formerly known as Twitter, he envisioned a platform where users could store money in their X accounts, send payments to other users, and potentially access high-yield money market accounts.The latest finding tells us the launch of a payment service is likely soon, which is in line with Musk’s previous goal of mid-2024, which he told Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood during an interview on X Spaces in December. Additionally, the company has been making progress on obtaining money transmitter licenses, allowing it to engage in money transfers in the U.S. Last week, X Payments (a wholly owned subsidiary of X) was granted a license in North Dakota, bringing the total number of states to 33. In July, it was approved in Alabama, California, and the District of Columbia. Others include Illinois, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia, and more. With X facing challenges in monetizing through advertising, the payment service is the company’s attempt at an alternative source of revenue. On Tuesday, the company just filed an antitrust lawsuit against advertising groups over an advertiser boycott that resulted in significant financial losses for X.

WSO2, an open source enterprise software provider with customers such as Samsung, Axa, and AT&T, recently agreed to be acquired by private equity giant EQT, at a valuation TechCrunch reported at the time to be north of $600 million. (We can now confirm that the valuation was in fact exactly $600 million.)The transaction, which remains subject to regulatory approvals, means that EQT will become WSO2’s sole owner, procuring all outstanding shares, including those of WSO2’s investors and current and ex-WSO2 employees.This liquidity event could also create significant wealth among those inclined to start their own ventures, given that 30% of the proceeds will be going to those employees.“This shows that equity is important — one of the things that we have insisted on from day one is that every employee has been a shareholder,” WSO2 co-founder and CEO Sanjiva Weerawarana told TechCrunch in an interview. “That’s very important, and it’s a concept that has not been understood here before, because there haven’t been companies that exited and gave any amount of meaningful financial return. Seeing is believing, right? Talk is cheap.”Thriving through war and unrestFounded out of the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, in 2005, WSO2 is a middleware stack constituting tools such as API management, similar to Apigee (Google acquired for $625 million), and identity and access management (IAM), along the lines of $15 billion publicly traded Okta.The main driving force behind this has been Weerawarana, a computer scientist and key figure in the open source community over the past 25 years, both as a member of the Apache Software Foundation and more recently as the creator of Ballerina, a cloud-native general-purpose programming language for integrating distributed systems.Prior to WSO2, Weerawarana worked within IBM’s research and development team in the U.S., where he helped develop web service specifications such as WSDL and BPEL. And it was there that the seed for WSO2 was sown.“I actually tried inside IBM to build a new kind of middleware stack, but IBM wasn’t interested,” Weerawarana said. “So the only option was either start a company or give up on the idea.”Weerawarana spawned WSO2 in August 2005 alongside two co-founders: Davanum Srinivas, who left after two years, and Weerawarana’s former IBM colleague Paul Fremantle, who would go on to serve as CTO until stepping down in 2015 (he later rejoined and then left again, but remains an advisor today).Notably, WSO2’s center of gravity has remained in Sri Lanka, despite a long-standing civil war and external pressure to relocate to the U.S., where Weerawarana had lived previously for 16 years.“I came back [to Sri Lanka] in 2001, and two weeks before I landed in Colombo, the airport was attacked by a terrorist group — there were still pieces of planes on the ground,” he said. “In 2005, the war was still going on. Sri Lanka as a country has not been able to maintain a consistent calm environment for us, but that’s okay.”Today, 80% of WSO2’s 780 employees are in Sri Lanka, with the remainder spread across a smattering of hubs in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.“I wanted to show we could build a product-oriented tech company from Sri Lanka,” Weerawarana continued. “There had never been a company like this, and at that time there wasn’t even a company out of India like this. Indian companies were very services-oriented, as were Sri Lankan companies. But one of the big prices [for staying in Sri Lanka] was that at pretty much every funding round, the majority of investors would ask when I was moving back [to the U.S.]. And my answer was always the same: ‘I’m not moving back.’”Investors weren’t the only ones who pressured WSO2 to move: Customers and competitors have also used its location against it at various junctures.“Some of our competitors fought against us, saying, ‘Do you know where they are located?’ and that becomes a challenge,” Weerawarana said. “Then we’ve had customers saying, ‘You’re located way over there. Why are you charging us these prices?’”On the flip side, WSO2’s geographic setting gave it the pick of technical talent, owning mostly to the fact that it was a product-based business in a sea of services.“We’ve never had a problem with engineering and technical talent. We’ve been able to hire the best people in Sri Lanka for the last 19 years,” Weerawarana said. “If you are a creative engineer, would you rather work for a services company, or be in a role where you could be creative and work on top-of-the-line technology?”WSO2 CEO Sanjiva Weerawarana speaks to media during a product launch in Colombo on February 26, 2014.Image Credits: Ishara S.KODIKARA/AFP via Getty ImagesIntel insideAfter WSO2 raised a small round of angel funding in 2005, Intel’s VC arm emerged as its earliest backer, investing in 2006 and through several follow-on rounds in subsequent years.Intel Capital’s initial $2 million cash injection was critical to WSO2’s early growth and was the result of fortuitous timing. Pradeep Tagare was a senior investment manager at Intel Capital at that time and met Weerawarana through their associations with the Apache Software Foundation. Tagare was looking to invest in an open source startup to complement a duo of other open source investments it had made — one into Java-centric application server company JBoss (which Red Hat later acquired for $350 million) and another into database company MySQL (which Sun later snapped up for $1 billion).“We were looking at a bunch of open source investments as a strategic initiative for Intel, essentially to build an alternate stack on Intel hardware,” Tagare explained to TechCrunch. “We had invested in JBoss, and we invested in MySQL. So we were now looking for an open source middleware company, and WSO2 fit the bill exactly.”Tagare’s thesis was that countries situated in Asia would not only stand to benefit from the open source movement, but would also be likely to contribute a lot. Open source software development is naturally distributed, opening up the coding and collaboration process to those who didn’t work at the Big Tech companies of those times.“Now they could contribute — before, it was all really controlled by the Microsofts and the Oracles of the world,” Tagare said. “Its location wasn’t necessarily a requirement, but being based in Asia just made WSO2 even more interesting.”Much has changed in the 20 years since WSO2 arrived on the scene. With the advent of cloud computing and microservices — software built from smaller, loosely connected components that can be developed and maintained independently and that conveniently rely on APIs — WSO2 has been well-positioned as enterprises transition from legacy monolithic applications.Now with the AI revolution in full swing, WSO2 is also set to capitalize given that APIs and IAM are key components of the AI stack — from integrations through authentication and beyond. Moreover, WSO2 is integrating AI into its own products, recently debuting a new API manager that allows developers to integrate an AI-powered chatbot into their APIs to allow non-coders to test APIs using natural language.According to Crunchbase data, WSO2 raised $133 million over the years. However, Weerawarana clarified that only $70 million was primary capital. Other rounds, like the $93 million Series E round two years ago led by Goldman Sachs, consisted of equity and debt.However the funding is sliced and diced, there’s no ignoring the fact that WSO2 was a startup dinosaur by the time EQT came calling. After all, most successful VC-backed companies reach an exit within 10 years.So what gives?“We’ve had multiple people wanting to buy our company through the years, but I resisted because I always wanted to build a company that would reach an IPO — an independent business, basically,” Weerawarana said.That all changed in May, when WSO2 accepted an offer from EQT Private Capital Asia (formerly Baring Private Equity Asia), a private equity firm EQT acquired in 2022 for more than $7 billion. The difference this time was simple: One of WSO2’s controlling shareholders “wanted to get liquidity,” according to Weerawarana.“Because they had more than 50%, it becomes a control transaction,” he said.That shareholder was San Francisco-based Toba Capital, a VC firm set up by Vinny Smith in 2012 after he sold Quest Software to Dell for more than $2 billion. Quest had previously invested in WSO2, equity that transferred to Dell through that acquisition — but Toba bought that stock back from Dell and went on to make further investments in WSO2, including buying Intel Capital’s portion. Toba Capital partner Tyler Jewell also replaced Weerawarana as CEO for a two-year period, with Weerawarana returning to the hot seat in 2020.Weerawarana says the company has been cash-flow positive since 2017 and profitable “since around 2018,” but it hasn’t had the luxury of vast pools of capital that would allow it to look at “multiple year strategies.” This is something it will be able to do under EQT, one of the world’s biggest private equity firms.Indeed, WSO2 says it will hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by Q3 this year, which is one of the key reasons EQT came calling.“WSO2 really has all the ingredients we look for in a software business,” EQT partner and global co-head of services Hari Gopalakrishnan told TechCrunch. “Deep and long-lasting enterprise client relationships, successful product-led-growth, technically robust products, and prudent financial management. Pick a strength, WSO2 probably has it.”From the outside, selling to private equity might not seem like the dream outcome for a founder with ambitions to go public and who values his company’s independence. But Weerawarana insists that this outcome will better enable WSO2 to do just that.“I started the company to make something that lasts. One of the reasons we didn’t sell it previously is that we knew that would be the end of it,” he said. “EQT doesn’t have any other businesses in this domain, they’re trying to build around WSO2, not merge it with something else. Their goal is to build the company for five years, which aligns with what I wanted, and gives us five years to get to an IPO.”Driving forceImage Credits: Marek Antoni Iwanczuk/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesWhile running WSO2 is a time-consuming endeavor on its own, Weerawarana keeps busy with other initiatives such as a philanthropic effort called the Avinya Foundation, which he established in 2022 to support economically disadvantaged children via vocational education programs.In 2017, Weerawarana also started driving for Uber, a move he says was designed to make it more socially acceptable in Sri Lanka to work in such jobs. If a successful businessman like him can do it, then anyone can.“I would be coming home from work and I would just pick somebody up along the way,” he said. “The main point I was trying to get across was that somebody who does a driving job is no different to somebody who does any other job — they’re just offering a service and you pay for it. We have this mindset here that people who do certain kinds of jobs are not the same as other kinds of people. And breaking that is very important — doing Uber-driving is part of it. The Avinya Foundation is also focused on that problem, trying to support all our skilled workers, such as tradespeople.”The pandemic, among other global events, put a temporary halt on Weerawarana’s Uber driving exploits; because people were doing it for survival, he didn’t want to take money from people who needed it.“I will do it again — things are getting much better,” he said. “Tourism is almost back to normal, so the demand will be there, and it might make sense for me to drive. But I don’t want to take any business from somebody else.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsEnterprise, eqt, evergreens, Sanjiva Weerawarana, sri lanka, Startups, WSO2 \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46B in Q2 as it drives toward a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t58 mins agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost-efficient versions — a sign of… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t1 hour agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

This could be a sign that Buffett has lost some faith in Apple, or he may just be in a selling mood — he’s been selling off other stocks as well, for example $3.8 billion of shares in Bank of America.The filing comes after Apple announced its third-quarter earnings on Thursday, with iPad growth offering a bright spot as global iPhone sales declined for the second consecutive quarter, due in part to competition in China from companies like Huawei.CEO Tim Cook said the company has been diverting resources to prepare to launch Apple Intelligence — a suite of AI features that it plans to release in the fall.

The home fitness firm experienced some of the industry’s highest highs and lowest lows in dizzying succession. It’s the story of a buzzy startup that garnered a cult-like following among influencers and fitness fanatics. A global pandemic shot the brand to unknown heights, before over-investment, recalls, mass layoffs and executive departures brought the brand crashing back down to earth.As of mid-2024, Peloton is down but not out. The company avoided a major liquidity crunch with a massive debt refinance at the end of May. That marked the end of a month that also saw a 15% staff reduction and the exit of CEO Barry McCarthy a little over two years after he took over for founder John Foley.Peloton’s high-profile roller-coaster ride has had wide-ranging knock-on effects. Excitement peaked at the height of the pandemic, but once the world began to reopen, sales cratered. Some who were hooked at the height of social distancing have remained loyal to the brand. Plenty of others, however, lost that connection. A degree of attrition is inevitable with any fitness offering, but those figures were unquestionably exacerbated by the reopening of gyms and other exercise alternatives.The result is that a lot of unused pieces of pricey fitness equipment are occupying space in homes across America; they’re now “clothing racks,” as a colleague recently referred to her Peloton bike. A quick search on Facebook Marketplace reveals row after row of the stationary bike, routinely listed around $300 to $500 — a fraction of the cost of a new model (around $1,500). For many once enthusiastic owners, the hardware has become a nuisance. But for a pair of East Coast entrepreneurs, it’s an opportunity.The Trade My Spin origin story starts modestly, when now CEO Ari Kimmelfeld began looking for a good deal on a used Peloton bike. As good as the Facebook and Craigslist prices were, relative to buying new from the manufacturer, the experience had its own issues.“There was a massive inconvenience, buying something that bulky,” Kimmelfeld, who was then working at Ernst & Young’s strategy consulting arm, EY-Parthenon, tells TechCrunch. “Five hundred dollars was a lot of money, and meeting up with a stranger and giving them money for a piece of equipment that you can’t really test out. Also, I live in New York City. Getting something like that from an apartment in Brooklyn to Manhattan is difficult. Also, there’s no warranty.”Local logisticsImage Credits: Trade My SpinKimmelfeld began a pilot for what would become Trade My Spin last year, picking up and selling used Peloton equipment. At its heart, the offering was a DIY logistics play, removing the friction from buying and selling used exercise equipment. It was a conversation with Joey Benjamini that transitioned the one-man operation into a viable business.Benjamini built contractor-based logistics network Collectible Classics. His Pennsylvania-based vintage car dealership relies on those contracted drivers to deliver vehicles primarily sold through used car platform, Bring a Trailer.“Logistics are the most complicated and the most important part of this business — and the biggest barrier to entry,” Benjamini tells TechCrunch. “We have a database of 1099 contractors who do deliveries for us. We’re constantly growing that network of drivers who know our company and our process. Once a driver is trained, we dispatch them to pick up bikes. It’s very simple.”The new team began work on the Trade My Spin site prior to seeking funding. The page remains simple, even as the inventory has grown to include Peloton’s treadmills, rower and a variety of accessories. A Buy button displays the service’s bustling marketplace, while Sell surfaces a form for the equipment you’re looking to unload. With the site in place, the young company raised a small pre-seed to scale operations.Talking to PelotonThe startup has also had multiple conversations with Peloton since officially launching in March. Trade My Spin’s primary goal with the calls is convincing that theirs is a symbiotic — rather than parasitic — relationship. At first glance, it’s easy to understand why Peloton might be antagonistic toward the company.Viewed as a zero-sum game, every used bike sold represents a potential lost sale on a new bike. While it’s true that keeping bikes in circulation is a net positive on the sustainability front, Peloton shareholders are no doubt looking at the sales bottom line in hopes of seeing a turnaround.The math changes, however, when considering that Peloton’s ultimate goal is being a content company that sells hardware, rather than the other way around. Rather than simply every used bike sale being a missed sale on a new one, Trade My Spin’s pitch is that every bike removed from circulation is one fewer subscription to Peloton’s content platform of classes.“Every bike we take is from someone who is not using that bike,” says Benjamini. “If someone’s not using the bike, they’re not using the subscription. Peloton is a subscription service. It’s $44 a month. Every time we flip a bike — and we’ve flipped thousands of bikes — they make $500 a year.”The relationship would no doubt be different had Peloton been more proactive about moving its own used equipment. Ultimately, however, Trade My Spin stepped in to fill that underserved hole in the market.A new spinTrade My Spin Founders (L-R): Ari Kimmelfeld and Joey BenjaminiTrade My Spin has pieced together a logistics network capable of offering same or next-day delivery in most major cities in the continental U.S. More-remote locales can take up to five days to complete, which is still faster than the three to five days Peloton takes to process orders.In the short term, expansion involves adding more fitness equipment to Trade My Spin’s buying and selling options. Longer term, the company is looking to leverage its growing network of contractors to include the buying and selling of all sorts of unwieldy objects. Trade My Spin will likely require an additional funding round to get there.“We want to transition,” Benjamini says. “We take it from where we’re currently at, and we build it into a large-scale marketplace for bulky items with logistics. That’s the game plan, and no else is going to do that. There’s a barrier to entry and a moat around the business with regards to having the drivers.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsGadgets, Hardware, Peloton, Startups \t\tTransportation\tRivian lost $1.46 billion in Q2 as it drives towards a VW-linked futureSean O'Kane\t46 mins agoRivian’s financial losses have crept up as it pushed out the last of its first-generation R1 trucks and SUVs in favor of newer, more cost efficient versions — a sign… \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t58 mins agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

Yet that’s exactly how Caleb Boyd and Kevin Bush started Molten Industries: in the garage of the Stanford professor’s on-campus home, where Kevin rented an apartment.It had everything they needed: space and, most importantly, power. The two wanted to break methane’s back, so to speak, stripping hydrogen from carbon in a way that didn’t emit atmosphere-warming carbon dioxide.“We call it a garage, but it was really just a carport. We plugged into his EV charger, heated up a methane pyrolysis reactor to around 1,000 Celsius and started cracking methane,” Boyd told TechCrunch.The professor who lived there “was super helpful,” Boyd said. “He would just come by, help us tinker with things and give us advice.”While the garage can still be a great place to do basic research, it’s the next step that poses a problem. Climate tech companies often face a “valley of death” between lab experiment and investable company.Founders have typically had to solve that problem themselves. But increasingly, investors are intervening early.When Boyd and Bush were still in the garage, they received a visit from Ashley Grosh, vice president at Breakthrough Energy, the climate tech organization founded by Bill Gates that includes a for-profit venture capital arm and various nonprofit programs. Grosh was representing one such program called Breakthrough Energy Discovery, a new division devoted to early-stage companies, the company told TechCrunch.Discovery is an evolution of Breakthrough’s Fellows program, which has been operating since 2021. Discovery identifies promising first-time founders, who are often fresh out of grad school or a postdoc and provides them with grants of up to $500,000, Grosh said. The organization has also created digital resources for common problems and pays for fellows to attend various conferences and meetings.To date, the Breakthrough Energy Fellows program has supported 42 companies spanning the gamut of climate tech, from cement and hydrogen to agriculture and fusion power. Altogether, the startups have raised a cumulative $250 million.Grosh has been overseeing the program since 2020. “The way we have built a thesis around this is there’s government funding, there are programs like ARPA-E, but they’re not really positioned to pick winners. They can do the science, but they’re not really going to go out and pick winners and double down on a company,” Grosh told TechCrunch.Venture capital has historically been hesitant to commit to companies that it considers too early. “We saw what happened in cleantech 1.0,” she said, referring to the first wave of climate-related investments that peaked about 15 years ago. “People came in a little too early. Now they’ve moved back and figured out where the strike zone is for venture. But I think what we’re seeing is that there’s still a lot of scientific discovery that needs to be done.”For investors who can stomach earlier stages, the advantage is clear: an early window into the founders of tomorrow. These bets tend to be riskier and because the valuations are lower and the checks are modest, the potential returns can be significant. “The term we use internally on this topic is proto-companies,” Johanna Wolfson, co-founder and general partner at Azolla Ventures, told TechCrunch. “It’s not a company yet, but if you squint, you can see how it could become a company.”Plus, in climate tech, moving earlier in the pipeline is about more than just returns. At Azolla Ventures, in particular, finding companies and opportunities that have been overlooked is part of the organization’s mandate. “As time passes, and as we keep missing our emissions targets, the crisis deepens,” Wolfson said. “And so it heightens the stakes to be able to make sure we’re not leaving anything on the table.” Funding basic research: Earlier than earlyFor Breakthrough Energy, the application process alone has helped it identify some promising areas where basic research still needs to be funded.“We started seeing some ideas that were further upstream. We’d say, ‘Oh, this is interesting. It’s not quite ready to be a fellow, but this research would be really helpful,” Grosh said. “We started to amass a list of those applications, and we then started funding a few as research grants.”Soon, Grosh and her team realized they’d need to be more systematic about it. Rather than put out the usual request for proposals, Breakthrough Energy Discovery started convening workshops for researchers spanning the spectrum of experience, from grad students to Nobel Prize winners. At a workshop, they would identify the most promising and impactful opportunities. “Out of that is where we will start to seed a couple of research projects,” Grosh said.Azolla Ventures is taking a slightly different tack, bringing on what they call a tech scout fellow. “We fund a graduate student to look around for interesting projects and tell us what they’re excited about,” Wolfson said, “because graduate students are going to be the ones who are the most plugged in.”The program is still young. So far, Azolla is working with grad students at Georgia Tech, a research powerhouse that the firm felt was being overlooked by venture capital. “If you had to guess how active the venture community is there, you’d probably guess less than MIT, Harvard, Stanford, or Berkeley just based on geography, unfortunately. Georgia Tech is an example of a place where we’re experimenting, we’re saying there’s probably some undervalued opportunities.”Even among the usual academic suspects, promising research can fall through the cracks and opportunities can be overlooked. It’s why Collaborative Fund gave Harvard University’s Wyss Institute $15 million to start a lab to research sustainable materials. The goal is to identify promising projects and scientists and sharpen them to the point where they’re ready to raise funds, according to partner Sophie Bakalar. From lab to real business: How founders benefitCollaborative gets first dibs on the projects, which have ranged from PFAS detection to addressing air-quality issues, and Bakalar is now also a visiting scholar at the Wyss Institute, maintaining a front row seat at the institute. Along the way, Bakalar and Collaborative offer support to help founders bridge the valley of death between lab project and investable startup. Bakalar said she expects the first project to emerge from the lab in the next couple months.Those sorts of resources can be helpful for the sort of founders that climate tech investors need. Many of them have spent years head down in the lab. Even if they had exposure to the business side through coursework, it’s an entirely different experience from running a startup.“We’re still based at a university,” said Mattia Saccoccio, co-founder and CTO of NitroVolt, which makes sustainable ammonia for fertilizer. “We sometimes miss the exchanges with other companies or companies that like us are working on climate solutions or on deep tech.”To counter that isolation, Breakthrough Energy groups its fellows into cohorts and encourages them to stay in touch during their tenure and after, including with the growing alumni network. “We meet regularly with other founders,” Saccoccio said. “I found that one of the most precious parts of the program.”Founders also said that access to Breakthrough Energy’s business fellows was particularly helpful. The business fellows are a mix of what VCs might consider advisers or operating partners.“If we need help with IP, we can get help there. If we want to get into the ammonia industry, there’s a fellow who has worked with industry and can help us open doors,” said Suzanne Zamany Andersen, co-founder and CEO of NitroVolt.For Boyd, the Molten Industries co-founder, the business fellows have been indispensable as his company has evolved. In addition to hydrogen, the company’s process also produces carbon. Initially, “we were like, we’re just going to bury it or put it in concrete or something,” he said. But as the startup went out to fundraise for a Series A, it started considering alternative uses, eventually settling on making graphite for lithium-ion batteries. “The whole Breakthrough Fellows team was super supportive during that, helping us not only think through that and what the implications would be, the pros, the cons, but then also just taking it in stride,” Boyd said. “As a founder, you want your investors to be partners alongside you and not freak out or be controlling. That’s something the Breakthrough Energy Fellows team does really well.”Ted McKlveen, co-founder and CEO of Verne, which is developing a new way to store hydrogen, agreed. “It does help get you from zero to one, from nothing to something that you can take to investors and say, ‘Okay, well, we got it, we’re real.’” Crossing the chasm from idea to reality is just the first of many that climate tech startups have to traverse. Not all will make it, but as investors and their affiliates step in to fill the gap, their odds are certainly improving.

Eleven years later, around 200 startups worldwide remain hopeful that growing meat from cells, rather than slaughtering animals, will one day be a major portion of our food supply. Despite their optimism, such success is not a given. In 2024, the industry has hit such rocky times that multiple startups have been forced to scale back or close shop. The industry is talking about eventually producing about 30 million pounds of finished product annually. However, more than 100 billion pounds of traditional meat is produced annually today. And if plant-based meat accounts for about 1% of all meat by volume, it’s going to take time for cultivated meat to get to that point, said Better Meat CEO Paul Shapiro, who wrote a book in 2018 called “Clean Meat.”Any goal that puts cultivated meat in big box grocery stores or on fast-food menus in the 2020s is “unrealistic,” he told TechCrunch.“Even if it were ready now, and the funding was available now, the time that it takes to build these factories is years. And the fact is, the money isn’t there for it, which is why a lot of these companies have abandoned their plans for commercial-scale factories,” Shapiro said.For instance, New Age Eats shut down in early 2023, with founder Brian Spears posting on LinkedIn that the company was unable to secure funds to complete its pilot facility. Berkeley-based Upside Foods laid off workers and put plans on hold for a new Chicago-area facility. Israel-based Aleph Farms let go of 30% of its staff in June, also citing difficulties in raising capital. San Francisco Bay Area-based SCiFi Foods also permanently closed in June. SCiFi CEO Joshua March shared on LinkedIn: “Unfortunately, in this funding environment, we could not raise the capital that we needed to commercialize the SCiFi burger, and SCiFi Foods ran out of time.” “It’s a really tough time right now, not just for cultivated meat, but any biotech related field,” said Tufts University Professor of Biomedical Engineering David Kaplan. “The economy is in the toilet, the investing funds are not there and people are being very, very cautious these days.”It’s important to note that the startups pursuing lab-grown meat are not just pursuing scientific curiosity or a more humane, but equally nutritious, protein alternative. Most global organizations, including the United Nations, are throwing out 2050 as the date when we will need to be producing 60% more food to feed the nearly 10 billion people expected to be inhabiting Earth. Those working on cultured meat hope it will be a significant portion of that 60%, with no need to slaughter animals or use the kind of land, water and energy resources needed by the traditional meat industry.Still, as promising as this field was 11 years ago, there has been frustratingly slow progress on the industry’s main barriers. Companies working on lab-grown meat — although the industry prefers the terms cell-cultured or cultivated meat — make it from animal cells, typically stem cells, that are fed growth factors in some sort of cell-feeding solution, or medium. The cells are fed and grown in bioreactors, then processed with ingredients and flavorings to mimic the taste, texture, look and mouth feel of traditional meat.Yet most companies are unable to produce large quantities of meat from their processes, much less at a low-enough cost or even at price parity with traditional meat. Moreover, the facilities cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to build. Achieving taste and texture is also a problem, as is changing the perceptions of people who tend to think of these products as unappetizing “Franken meat.”On top of all that, very few companies have achieved regulatory approval in the U.S. for their cultivated meat processes.Perhaps the biggest difficulty of all is the downturn in venture capital funding. In 2021 and 2022, cultivated meat companies pulled in over $1.6 billion in venture funding, according to Crunchbase analysis. As of June, Crunchbase was showing around $20 million in funding into this industry so far in 2024.“Changing the world and reinventing the food system is hard, which is probably the least shocking conclusion that one can come to,” Amy Chen, chief operating officer for Upside Foods, told TechCrunch.However, she, like all others in the cultured-meat industry, believes it can be done. She thinks there will be a point in development where some kind of Moore’s law equivalent will kick in, and the industry will start seeing dramatic increases in production and achieve regulatory approval, which will increase the ways this product is brought to market, driving affordability and public acceptance.Upside Foods’ cultivated chicken filet.Image Credits: Upside FoodsGovernment funding to the funding rescue?Before these companies can solve their technical problems, they must first overcome their funding ones. Lever VC managing partner Nick Cooney says investment into the category “has dropped considerably in the last year or so,” largely due to the general drop in VC funding overall. “But this sector is outpacing that drop,” Cooney said. The problem is that (other than all things AI), VCs are currently avoiding funding tech that has enormous upfront capital costs, doesn’t currently produce much (if any) revenue (let alone profits), and may never prove to be viable businesses. “VCs have largely made this shift from growth to profitability, and that’s wreaked havoc” on this industry, said Alex Frederick, senior emerging technology analyst at PitchBook. It’s difficult to be profitable when you don’t have a product to sell, he points out. PitchBook puts fundraising into cultivated meat at a double-digits decline over the past few years, Frederick said. The first quarter of 2024 was on pace to somewhat match the low pace of 2023 funding with 12 deals logged so far. Another 20 or so more potential deals are in the pipeline, he said.At the start of 2024, there were around 200 cultured meat companies worldwide, according to PitchBook. But because most cultivated meat companies are startups, if they lose their ability to raise more venture funding, they tend to go out of business or be acquired. That’s the stage where Tuft’s Kaplan says the market sits now and, unfortunately, he has no prediction on when that will change, or how many will survive.One possible solution is for startups to outsource cell manufacturing, leasing equipment and production rather than each of them spending $100 million to $200 million on their own facilities, Frederick says. Venture capitalists have liked this approach and infused some funding into companies doing this, like Ark Biotech, Prolific Machines, Pow.bio, No Meat Factory and Planetary.Another funding option, Kaplan points out, is if governments are willing to kick in. Singapore, the first country to approve cultured meat for consumer consumption, is doing so. It’s committed $230 million to research of alternative proteins. And the Israel Innovation Authority has an $18 million fund for alternative protein startups and research. Tufts’ Kaplan believes we’ll see more countries follow.“In a world that’s kind of struggling right now with food security, it will become how much can the government invest into this approach,” he said. “Just like the government has invested in battery technology and chips, they are going to have to do the same thing for cultivated meat if we are going to make this work.”He has reason to hope. He points to Mosa Meat’s $300,000 hamburger, saying that most companies today can make the same hamburger for $20. Yes, that’s still way more costly than a McDonald’s Big Mac, but in 10 years, there was a four orders of magnitude reduction in cost with minimum government investment, he said.‘Massive’ engineering hurdles Others point out that even if money wasn’t so tight, the industry still hasn’t figured out how to make enough meat. Upside Foods knows about this. A lot about this. So does competitor Eat Just. Founder Josh Tetrick said his company has sold 10 times the amount of cultivated meat as the entire rest of the industry combined. “But that’s hardly any meat,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s in the single digit thousands of pounds, just to give you a sense of how small the volumes are, since only a handful of companies have regulatory approval.”Eat Just and Upside Foods are two of the only companies to receive regulatory approval to sell this meat to consumers, with Eat Just being the first to sell in Singapore and then the United States. Tetrick is using this market advantage to focus on how to make millions of pounds at or below the cost of conventional meat. But “there are massive engineering and technological hurdles to be overcome,” he said. For instance, his company is working on increasing cell densities, or edible cells produced per unit volume. That’s a key metric for manufacturers in order to produce the maximum amount of meat from each bioreactor. There are a variety of bioreactor technologies, each with different approaches to cell density. Some use batch methods (fixed amount of cells and the growth food medium processed at one time); others use continuous methods (a steady stream of inputs/outputs). Some stir the cells when adding fresh cell food; others suspend the cells and rotate the walls of the reactor.Which of these technologies will be reliably best is still a matter of scientific research. Cultivated meat producer Believer Meats, for instance, showed in a 2023 study that cells grown in suspension can deliver densities of over 100 billion cells per liter — which it claims is over 17 times the industry standard. This increased process yields from 2% to 36% weight per volume of edible meat per run. Image of WildType’s sushi-grade, lab-grown salmon.Image Credits: Arye Elfenbein/WildTypeCostly cell foodBeyond the reactor engineering, another major hurdle is both the engineering and cost of the cell growth medium. Cell media typically includes a mixture of an energy source, like glucose, that includes amino acids, salts, vitamins, water and other components. Along with the hundreds of millions of dollars to build a facility, the cost to produce this media at scale is quite expensive. A 2022 study by the Department of Agricultural Economics at Oklahoma State University found that 1 kilogram (equal to about 2 pounds) of cell-cultured meat was estimated to cost $63 to produce. That was compared to $6.17 per kilogram for beef.Wildtype, for instance, is making cultivated salmon. It started with a single cell and hasn’t needed to go back to an animal to obtain more cells for five years now, according to co-founder Aryé Elfenbein. It has now gained more understanding in how to best feed these cells to improve cell density.“We’ve improved the yield of that process over time by understanding what nutrients these cells do best in,” Elfenbein said. “Raw fish is just extraordinarily complex, and all the aromatics and different components are something that we’ve aspired to create a more difficult, structured product from the beginning.”The industry is also still working on methods to get the cells without taking them from animals. MarineXcell, for instance, is developing a way to produce embryonic stem-like cells, called induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, from crustacean cells — like lobster, shrimp and crab — using advanced nuclear reprogramming technologies. The Israeli-based company says the technology, backed by Yissum, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem’s tech transfer company, and spearheaded by chief scientific officer Yossi Buganim, accelerates cell growth twice as fast as adult stem cells, but also maintains differentiation and cell growth potential over time, even under suboptimal conditions. Buganim’s lab was able to do this with bovine cells and is now applying similar techniques to crustaceans.Getting along with the governmentFounders say that the lack of regulatory policies is holding the industry back, too.“It’s the main reason why quite a number of companies haven’t launched products yet,” Wildtype co-founder Justin Kolbeck said. “They’re on the journey during a multi-year regulatory review process, which is what consumers are watching. They want to make sure that the food regulators are taking their time looking under every stone, making sure that what we’re putting out on the market is as safe as possible.”That said, no one thinks food safety is an area to skimp on — Wildtype’s conversations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were “constructive and positive iterative processes for a number of years now,” Kolbeck said. However, the company has also had conversations with potentially large customers interested in buying their products today. And Kolbeck doesn’t want to speculate when Wildtype’s regulatory approval will come.Upside’s Chen said progress is being made. She believes regulators now have a better understanding about what cultivated meat is and more educated safety and regulatory concerns.“When we got the first FDA approval, and others followed, it pretty much answered the question of, ‘Could this ever be approved and is it safe?’ Now our next-generation products need to go through a similar regulatory process, but that’s more of a ‘when,’ not an ‘if,’” she said.Scientist holding petri dish with cultured meat. Image Credits: Liudmila Chernetska (opens in a new window) / Getty ImagesPublic perceptionBoth Upside Foods and Eat Just tested out their cultivated chicken products in a few restaurants following regulatory approval. However, Upside’s Chen and Eat Just’s Tetrick say those pilots have ended until they can scale further. One thing they learned: Wide consumer appeal remains a problem, with people calling it “Frankenfood,” “faux meat” or “lab-grown” meat — which technically it is — but those descriptions don’t sound appetizing. Florida has even already banned lab-grown meat. “A challenge for all of us is how to help consumers fall in love with the category, understand what cultivated meat is, why we are behind it and what’s in it for them,” Chen said.Tuft’s Kaplan believes that more education, more transparency by the industry and more peer-reviewed published papers from respected universities, will all help. Chen expects the field to be very different even two years from now. She’s optimistic that consumers in a variety of geographies will be able to take their first bite of cultivated meat and “that it will be delicious.” Lever VC’s Cooney also sees real progress being made. He points to Lever’s portfolio company Clever Carnivore, a cultivated meat company that has raised around $9 million. “From a price point reduction standpoint, they’ve found a way to produce meaningful pilot quantities at quite a reasonable capex,” Cooney said.In the meantime, Eat Just’s approach overall will be what the company is doing currently in Singapore with launching its cultivated meat in retail. The product is 3% cultivated meat, while the other portion is plant-based proteins. Tetrick admits it is significantly less than the 60+% Eat Just first launched in 2020. However, by developing meat at 3%, he believes the company can significantly drive the cost down, thus building more consumer experience and awareness around cultivated meat.He has a plan to increase that 3% over the next three to five years, while at the same time working on a lower-cost infrastructure, working on getting cell densities up and working on getting media costs down.“We don’t think there’s anything magical about it,” Tetrick said. “We just have to do the necessary work across those different dimensions to get it done.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsalternative protein, Biotech & Health, cultivated meat, Eat Just, Fundraising, lab-grown meat, Startups, Upside Foods \t\tAI\tAmazon upgrades its AI image generatorKyle Wiggers\t5 mins agoAmazon has released an upgraded version of its in-house image-generating model, Titan Image Generator, for AWS customers using its Bedrock generative AI platform.

But unlike some pandemic-driven trends (virtual conferences, Zoom happy hours), the interest in outdoor activities has stuck.By the end of 2023, outdoor participation grew to a record 175.8 million people, or 57% of all Americans aged six and older, according to the Outdoor Industry Association.But the influx of interest exposed the lack of innovation in many parts of this industry. From over-the-phone bookings to cash payments to a gear market dominated by legacy brands, the outdoor recreation category was full of opportunity for entrepreneurs.In the past couple of years, entrepreneurs have built SaaS software for hunting and fishing guides. Founders have developed AI-powered companies that find and book golf tee times. Kevin Durant invested in a startup that helps people locate pickleball courts. And the list goes on.VCs, meanwhile, have been interested as well. In 2019, VCs invested $48.60 million into 25 sports tech companies, according to PitchBook. In 2021 that rose to $949.26 million and 53 companies; in 2023, during the VC winter, investments totaled $189.71 million and 43 companies. While that’s a major crash from 2021 (when VC investing was record-breaking across all industries), the dollars invested last year still represent a 290% increase over 2019’s pre-pandemic levels.Online accelerationBenjamin Lazarov, the co-founder and CEO of AnyCreek, a startup building booking and back-end business software for fishing and hunting guides, told TechCrunch that he would never have thought of building his company before the pandemic. But then Lazarov tried to book a fishing guide in Vermont in 2022.He had asked the cashier at a nearby Orvis for some local guide recommendations and she gave him a paper list of seven names to call. As he called and left voicemails, it dawned on him that everything else had moved online during COVID-19, why was he still trying to book a guided fishing trip over the phone? After that he left his role as a regional director of growth at Compass and launched AnyCreek.“My thought is that had I tried to start this business five years before COVID-19, no way,” Lazarov said. “COVID-19 definitely accelerated the adoption to more technology. There is a new generation of guides that are tech first, mobile first, they are operating every other part of their life online.”Mallard Bay is another startup bringing hunting and fishing guides online. The Houston, Texas-based company launched in 2019 and saw its site blossom after lockdowns eased in 2021, from 19 guides on the platform to over 100, co-founder and CEO Logan Meaux told TechCrunch.Loop Golf, a startup that automates finding and booking a tee time at a public golf course, was founded as a response to the increase in new golfers making it difficult for existing players to play. Matthew Holder, the co-founder and CEO of Loop Golf, told TechCrunch in June that he got the idea when he realized that the rise in interest in golf that occurred post-pandemic wasn’t going away.“It became increasingly more difficult to find a tee time,” Holder said. “I’d be spending hours looking at the different options. I got fed up with it and my wife definitely got fed up with it.”Behavior changesWhen the world was forced to move online, consumers learned to expect to interact with all businesses that way, Lazarov said. People simply don’t want to go back to booking things over the phone, and they want technology to do more for their recreational lives, just as it’s doing in their work and personal lives in other areas.It’s like a restaurant in New York that updated its point of sale system to handle cashless transactions. “They are never going back,” Lazarov said, because the new POS system “helps them better operate their business. Think of how much more money they can make.”Scott Holloway, a managing partner at Starting Line, and an investor in AnyCreek, said that people, especially younger generations, are increasingly looking to spend more money on experiences than physical things. This trend has been well-documented in numerous surveys dating back to a decade ago. He added that the companies building the tech to power those experience-based transactions are in a smart position.Plus, people often need to buy new gear and equipment to do said new activities.Numerous startups have also popped up to supply gear, clothes and accessories for these new hobbyists. Eastside Golf and Malbon Golf are both venture-backed startups looking to outfit and accessorize new-found golf fans that maybe don’t want to look like 1960’s era Arnold Palmer. Nettie and Recess are startups designing pickleball paddles that don’t look like they came from a retirement community in Florida.Early venture-backed entrants to this category like Hipcamp, a booking platform for campsites, and AutoCamp, a glamping company, showed that there was consumer appetite for innovation in this category years ago. Now, more than 10 years later, Holloway thinks there is still so much entrepreneurs can do.There’s reason to believe he’s right. Rental services for things like canoes, kayaks and stand-up paddleboards still have websites that look like they were built in 2002. Ditto for those offering services for everything from archery to ziplines. Many businesses in the outdoor recreation category could still use some tech help.“The market is massive,” Holloway said. “As Marc Andreessen famously said, ‘software is eating the world,’ but this is one of the last pieces of consumer spend that software hasn’t eaten. Consumers are demanding it. It’s a massive market opportunity to ride that wave.”This piece has been updated to correct AnyCreek’s founding story.

The newly raised funds come a little over a year since Aurora completed a capital raise of $820 million from a public and concurrent private offering of its stock. “This raise is a testament to investors’ confidence in Aurora’s ability to be a company for the long term, prompted by a recent Analyst Day where investors experienced driverless truck rides, and recent milestones that underscore the strength of our partner ecosystem to deploy at scale,” company spokesperson Rachel Chibidakis told TechCrunch in an email. Aurora made its public debut through a special purpose acquisition merger in 2021, and its stock has traded as high as $13.12 on opening day. Aurora shares closed Friday at $3.84. Shares rose more than 2% in after-hours trading. Aurora is pursuing a driver-as-a-service model, wherein carriers purchase trucks with the Aurora Driver tech on board and then offer their services via those trucks to shippers. But the company is planning to go to market as a carrier, offering up to 20 autonomous Paccar and Volvo trucks to shippers at the end of this year. Aurora first revealed Thursday plans to sell up to $420 million worth of Class A common stock to underwriters Goldman Sachs, Allen & Company and Morgan Stanley, according to an SEC filing. The Thursday agreement came a day after Aurora filed a prospectus offering to sell $350 million worth of shares. Someone familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that due to strong investor demand, the offering had been upsized to $420 million.Aurora expected the net proceeds from the sale to bring in about $405 million, or around $466 million “if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full,” after deducting the usual discounts, commissions and offering expenses, per an updated filing. The deal closed Friday afternoon pushed the raise to $483 million.  Aurora did not respond Thursday to questions about how it intends to use the net proceeds. The Thursday filing provided few hints, stating vaguely that the company will put the money toward “working capital and other general corporate purposes.” The company also wrote in its filing that it’ll first invest the proceeds from this offering into “short and long-term investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or guaranteed obligations.”Aurora provided more detail after the deal closed Friday.“This opportunistic raise gives us runway well into 2026, putting us on the path to deploy driverless trucks at scale and become a cash flow positive company, which we expect in 2028,” said Chibidakis, adding that as the company approaches its planned commercial launch that enthusiasm is building. “Our continued momentum and more favorable market conditions made this an opportune time to raise additional capital.”The bid for more funds comes as Aurora reports its second-quarter results. As of June 30, 2024, Aurora had $402 million in cash and cash equivalents and $618 million in short-term investments. Not including the proceeds from its offering, the company expects this to be enough to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2025.In Q2 2024, Aurora spent $198 million, which is a direct loss because the startup isn’t yet pulling in any revenue. The company is slated to start its commercial service later this year on the Uber Freight network. In June, the two companies announced a multi-year collaboration that will see Aurora’s autonomous driving technology offered on the Uber Freight network through 2030.Update: This story was updated to reflect that Aurora’s $618 million in short-term investments are essentially liquid.This story was originally published August 1, 2024 at 9:34 am PT. It has been updated to include estimated proceeds per an additional SEC filing. The article was updated Friday at 4:31 pm PT after Aurora had announced the final raise amount.

But in the quest for greater energy efficiency, builders are sealing things up. Tight buildings keep indoor temperatures more consistent, but they can also trap humidity.“Essentially, buildings are being made more and more like beer coolers. It’s great for energy efficiency, but it’s pretty clear that people don’t like living in beer coolers,” Stein said. “And it leads to all of these other problems, like moisture damage.”Running a dehumidifier is one option, but they can be noisy and expensive. Stein, who used to be a physics professor at Brown University, came up with another: a two-material system that helps homes self-regulate their internal humidity. His inspiration? Trees and semiconductor diodes.Trees and other plants regulate their temperature in part by transpiring water through small pores in their leaves. If they get too hot, they open those pores and let more water evaporate, just like sweat cools our skin. When the temperature drops, they can close the pores to slow the rate of transpiration. Stein figured that if he could find a way to similarly absorb and disperse water vapor at the right times, he could make buildings more comfortable and energy efficient.Lots of materials can do that, but they’re not very smart about where they disperse the moisture. Without something to help the moisture move in the desired direction — outside of a wall cavity, for example — mold and rot could result.That’s where the diode came in. As a physicist, Stein was intimately familiar with their operation. In a diode, electrons can flow freely in one direction but are resisted in the other. Essentially, they operate like a one-way door.What he devised was a system of two materials. One acts as a sponge to absorb water vapor and release it over time. The other is a more typical weather-resistive barrier, which helps block air flow while allowing water vapor to pass through it. Stein’s sponge layer helps serve as traffic cop: When mounted to an exterior wall, the spongy layer will pull moisture away out of the house through the inward-facing barrier. It stays there until the sun warms the outside of the wall and evaporates the moisture. Builders buy a lot of weather-resistive barriers, about $14 billion worth in 2022, according to Global Market Insights. But the construction industry tends to be cautious when it comes to new technologies, in part because fixing any problem they cause can be costly. “In construction, the valley of death is usually deep and wide,” Stein said, referring to the gap between developing a product and actually getting customers to buy it.To traverse the valley, Adept is designing its building wrap to look and feel like the old stuff. “One of the big barriers to adoption is that something looks and feels different,” he said. “People are resistant to change.”While Adept refines its water-resistive barriers, the startup will sell another product, a paint and primer system aimed at bathrooms. The primer serves as the barrier layer, while the paint serves as the sponge. As humidity rises in the bathroom, the super-absorbent paint draws in moisture and doesn’t release it until the humidity in the bathroom drops. To test the paint’s performance, Adept built a bathroom-sized room and boiled water to raise the humidity. The paint managed to keep the humidity down by 14% compared with conventional paint, Stein said. Adept’s paint and primer will hit the market early next year.The startup recently raised a $4 million seed round to help bring the paint to market while continuing development of the water-resistive barrier. The round was led by D.R. Horton with PulteGroup participating. Both are among the largest homebuilders in the U.S.“As a startup company, you want to pilot runs and stuff like that, but people might not give you the time of day,” Stein said. “But if the biggest homebuilder in the U.S. says this is interesting to us, then it moves the needle.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsAdept Materials, Climate, energy efficient homes, Exclusive, Fundraising, materials science, Startups \t\tAI\tGoogle Assistant lives to automate another dayBrian Heater\t10 mins agoWith new Pixel devices just over the horizon, Assistant’s days on Android may still be numbered.

At its peak, Rediff was valued at over $600 million on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It also drove some of the largest traffic in India, climbing at least up to the 12th spot, according to brokerage house Jefferies.A Credit Suisse research note from 2001 about RediffImage Credits: Screenshot: Manish Singh/TechCrunchThe company struggled to adapt to the evolving digital landscape in the 2000s and 2010s. As social media platforms and specialized e-commerce sites gained prominence, Rediff’s broad portal model became increasingly obsolete. Despite attempts to diversify its offerings, it failed to compete effectively against more nimble rivals and eventually delisted from Nasdaq. Infibeam said Friday that Rediff still drives more than 55 million visits each month. It plans to tap Rediff’s user base to cross-sell financial products, including loans, insurance and investment advisory. Rediff reported $4 million in revenue in the financial year ending in March.       More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsIndia, Infibeam Avenues, rediff.com, Venture \t\tApps\tX is getting closer to launching its payment serviceLauren Forristal\t15 mins agoX (formerly Twitter) appears to be making progress on its upcoming payments system, bringing it closer to Elon Musk’s vision of turning X into an “everything app.”   According to a… \t\tSpace\tDawn Aerospace’s rocket-propelled aircraft takes flightAria Alamalhodaei\t15 mins agoDawn Aerospace’s rocket-powered aircraft soared to new heights in its latest test campaign, as the company looks to build what could be the highest-performance aircraft to take off from a… \t\tHardware\tMade by Google 2024: Pixel 9, Gemini, a new foldable and other things to expect from the eventBrian Heater\t17 mins agoGoogle unveiled the Nest Learning Thermostat 4 and Google TV Streamer.

As part of the deal, Microsoft runs OpenAI’s models across its enterprise and consumer products and is OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider.However, the tech giant called the startup a “competitor” for the first time in an SEC filing on Tuesday.In Microsoft’s annual 10K, OpenAI joined a long list of competitors in AI, alongside Anthropic, Amazon, and Meta. OpenAI was also listed alongside Google as a competitor to Microsoft in search, thanks to OpenAI’s new SearchGPT feature announced last week.It’s possible Microsoft is trying to change the narrative on its relationship with OpenAI in light of antitrust concerns — the FTC is currently looking into the relationship, alongside similar cloud provider investments into AI startups. Microsoft recently agreed to give up its board observer seat at the startup — a seat it gained after a kerfuffle last fall when OpenAI’s board briefly fired CEO Sam Altman, prompting Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to offer him and other top execs jobs at Microsoft.However, SEC filings like this are often places where corporations throw out hyper-cautious warnings to investors.Partners and competitors are certainly not mutually exclusive titles in Silicon Valley. In the year 2000, the dominant search engine at the time, Yahoo, announced an agreement to let Google’s search results appear on its web page. The two companies were partners for a few years, until Google ate Yahoo’s lunch in search and became the unofficial, but dominant, doorstep to the internet. The two companies were partners, but were still threats to each other. (Yahoo is the owner of TechCrunch.)There’s enough history of this kind of power-switch in tech that it’s at least conceivable that Microsoft and OpenAI’s relationship will take a similar route. Regardless, Microsoft is not putting all its eggs in one basket.In March, Microsoft hired the co-founders of billion-dollar AI startup Inflection AI, Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan, to lead its new Microsoft AI division. The cloud provider is investing heavily into Microsoft Copilot and building out an AI future that’s entirely separate from OpenAI.

She’s a mocumentary filmmaker working on a project about an alternate reality where charades is big business. She’s a caesar salad connoisseur and documents her rankings of different restaurants’ attempts on a blog called JULIUS. She’s also Northzone’s newest partner.Alter’s path to venture capital was not an obvious one. Her parents were journalists and she grew up heavily involved in creative passions like theater and improv comedy. These interests were the basis for the company Alter started at Harvard that filmed a cappella concerts and dance recitals and ultimately led her to VC.She told TechCrunch that she really just started that company as a way to make money — it was better than her other job cleaning toilets — but it morphed into a real business that scaled up to 27 employees. Then Insight Partners came knocking via a message sent on Facebook Messenger to see if Alter wanted to join their analyst program.“I went to Insight straight out of undergrad,” said Alter, who graduated from Harvard. “My rationale was that I’m not from this world. I don’t know anything about these different businesses and business models. There is a lot for me to learn about starting companies. I’ll get a broad exposure and after a couple years, I’ll start my next company.”She didn’t end up starting that other business and has been in venture ever since. After nearly five years at Insight, she moved over to Index as a partner out of their London office in 2020. She moved to Northzone and to New York City in 2023. Now she’s being promoted to partner at the firm and will continue her focus on vertical software. Northzone is a multistage firm that currently backs startups in the U.S. and Europe out of its €1.1 billion 10th fund.While Alter assumed she’d go back to being an entrepreneur, she realized being a VC was a better fit for her and that building blocks for that career were always there even if she hadn’t noticed them. She said as a kid, she was always questioning and was obsessed with how things were made and where they came from down to the bread she used to make toast.“What you are doing at its core by investing in innovation, is finding out how things work right now and how things could be better,”Alter said.Alter said she likes that being a VC requires her to go deep into a subject and learn all the ins and outs about it. She said her investment in GovDash is a great example. While software for government contracts may not seem super interesting on the surface, Alter said she was fascinated by all the intricacies like how even a government contract for a janitor needs to be vetted for potential corruption.“This is such an exciting job,” Alter said. “You are learning about things that are right under your nose and learning how these things work today and if they are broken how an entrepreneur could fix that.”Alter thinks her creative background and current pursuits has made her a better investor. A direct example is that her interest in film led her to source a Series C investment into Frame.io in 2019 when she was at Insight. The company built a cloud-based video collaboration platform, which Alter understood the need for immediately based on her past experiences in film. The company later exited through a $1.3 billion sale to Adobe in 2021 after raising about $90 million.She added that she thinks it helps in less tangible ways too. She likes having other things to talk about with founders to help them relax and not feel like they need to be talking about their company 24/7.“I do have a ton of diverse interests and it helps me build stronger relationships with founders and build that trust to go through thick and thin,” Alter said. Being a VC hasn’t always been the easiest job, Alter said, but she’s ready to double down on investing with this latest role. She wants to cut through the AI noise to find the startups with real potential and she remains bullish on vertical software and investing out of New York.“I think there were times where I had to exercise that grit and feel like I was pushing a rock up a hill,” Alter said. “It hasn’t been easy but I have really felt that this is the right industry for me to be in. My test of that is, am I excited on a Sunday night to launch into a week of meeting founders or do I get Sunday scaries? Sundays at Northzone, I’m chomping at the bit.”      More TechCrunchGet the industry’s biggest tech newsExplore all newslettersTechCrunch Daily NewsEvery weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.Startups WeeklyStartups are the core of TechCrunch, so get our best coverage delivered weekly.TechCrunch FintechThe latest Fintech news and analysis, delivered every Tuesday.TechCrunch MobilityTechCrunch Mobility is your destination for transportation news and insight.Email address (required)SubscribeBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.\t\t\tTagsEurope, Index Ventures, Insight Partners, North America, Northzone, Startups, Startups, United States, VCs, Venture, Venture Capitalists \t\tApps\tX is getting closer to launching its payment serviceLauren Forristal\t2 hours agoX (formerly Twitter) appears to be making progress on its upcoming payments system, bringing it closer to Elon Musk’s vision of turning X into an “everything app.”   According to a… \t\tSpace\tDawn Aerospace’s rocket-propelled aircraft takes flightAria Alamalhodaei\t2 hours agoDawn Aerospace’s rocket-powered aircraft soared to new heights in its latest test campaign, as the company looks to build what could be the highest-performance aircraft to take off from a… \t\tHardware\tMade by Google 2024: Pixel 9, Gemini, a new foldable and other things to expect from the eventBrian Heater\t2 hours agoGoogle unveiled the Nest Learning Thermostat 4 and Google TV Streamer.

This is the company’s fifth round since April 2021, when it cut back 100 staffers. Rad’s latest layoffs follow a culling a year ago, when the e-bike maker pulled out of Europe and laid off around 40 employees. Rad laid off staff twice in 2022.The layoffs at the popular e-bike startup come after VanMoof, another venture-backed e-bike darling, declared bankruptcy last year. The turbulence in the e-bike industry has demonstrated that manufacturing and shipping two-wheelers is a tough business to get right, particularly if a startup is under pressure to scale quickly to provide investors with a return on investment.  Rad did not share how many staffers it cut in July or which teams were affected. Sources familiar with the layoffs told TechCrunch the cuts mostly hit Rad’s product development teams. According to LinkedIn, Rad Power employs 394 people. “Earlier this month, Rad Power Bikes made the difficult decision to reduce our team’s size so we can ensure the brand’s longevity, continue on our mission, and serve our rider community,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We are doing all we can to approach this very difficult time with compassion and care. We believe in and care deeply about our vision to create a world where transportation is energy-efficient, enjoyable, and accessible to all. We have faced the challenges many businesses have, including rising costs and economic headwinds, and this difficult decision was necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of Rad’s business.”A spokesperson for the company said Rad will continue to provide service and support to its customers with daily live phone and chat customer service, as well as through more than 1,200 retail and service providers throughout North America. Rad Power Bikes, known for their affordable fat tire e-bikes, has gone through some shake-ups since its meteoric rise to popularity that was fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the company’s founder, Mike Radenbaugh, stepped down as CEO and into the role of chairman. He was replaced by Phil Molyneux, who previously served as president at Sony Electronics and Dyson America. Correction: A previous version of this story stated Rad Power Bikes made their bikes in the U.S. They are made in Asia.

It’s part of Google Cloud’s effort to cozy up with promising early-stage AI startups, in hopes some of them will evolve into massive, compute-hungry businesses.“We want to surround them with a lot of love and warmth early in their life cycle so they get familiarized with building and working on the Google Cloud Platform,” said general manager for Google Cloud’s startups and AI business, James Lee, in an interview with TechCrunch. “As they stick around, we grow as they grow, and we become a partner of theirs throughout their life cycle.”Specifically, Google will provide a dedicated cluster with priority access for YC’s Summer 2024 startups, along with $350,000 in cloud credits over two years for each participating startup. The idea is that a future unicorn will fall in love with building on Google Cloud. Five percent of Y Combinator startups over the last 18 years have become unicorns with billion-dollar-plus valuations, YC group partner Diana Hu tells TechCrunch, so it’s a decent bet for Google to make on this partnership.“There’s a lot of excitement that the next generation of startups will probably not just unicorn, but decacorn, and they’re getting built as we speak,” said Hu. “Cloud providers are still catching up in terms of how to price them, but they do know if you catch them early on, you’re going to ride the wave with them.”On the flip side, Y Combinator says it can attract more AI startups to apply by offering generous compute resources alongside its investment and guidance. For early-stage AI startups, Hu says one of the most common issues she hears is that startups are compute-restrained. Large enterprises are able to strike multi-year, massive deals with cloud providers for GPU access, but small startups are often left out to dry. She says partnerships like these go a long way, especially when you have a dedicated cluster — that’s particularly important for training AI models.“For GPU and AI workloads, they’re more like high performance computing workloads in batches. You don’t need the server running all the time, but you need a lot of them in a spiky workload,” said Hu. “So we have a dedicated cluster that YC companies can just use.”As part of the partnership, Google will also offer YC startups $12,000 in Enhanced Support credits and a free year of Google Workspace Business Plus. YC startups can also connect with Google’s internal AI experts through monthly office hours.Startup accelerators and venture capital firms are offering GPU clusters more and more these days. Andreessen Horowitz reportedly has a stash of 20,000 GPUs to attract AI startups. Google Cloud and Y Combinator would not reveal the exact number in this deal, but Hu says it’s sufficient for YC’s foundation model companies to train models on.

Her parents, though, didn’t have the aerodynamic expertise to support her newfound passion, and her teachers were too overwhelmed to give her dedicated attention. “That’s why I wanted to build an AI that can help provide every single kid with their own dedicated coach and playmate that can chat with them and help the kids learn,” Qu told TechCrunch.Qu is the founder of Heeyo, a startup that offers children between the ages of three and 11 an AI chatbot and over 2,000 interactive games and activities, including books, trivia and role-playing adventures. Heeyo also lets parents and kids design their own AI and create new learning games tailored to family values and kids’ interests — something for kids to do instead of playing Minecraft and Roblox and watching endless YouTube videos.Heeyo came out of stealth on Thursday with a $3.5 million seed round from OpenAI Startup Fund, Alexa Fund, Pear VC and other investors, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. Its app is now available on Android and iOS tablets and smartphones globally.I know what you’re thinking. AI for kids sounds creepy — dangerous even. What precautions is Heeyo taking to ensure kids’ safety? How is it protecting children’s data? How will talking to an AI chatbot affect a child’s mental health?Qu says safety is at the core of Heeyo’s product, from the way it handles data to how its chatbot engages with kids on sensitive issues to parental controls. And while the tech is still new, it does appear that Heeyo is taking the proper steps to make its app a healthy learning experience for kids and families. Based on my experience, the chatbot — which kids can play on their own or with siblings and parents — is supportive of emotional issues and always prompts kids with fun and interactive learning games.  Going after the children’s market in a safe and engaging way also allows Heeyo to carve out a niche for itself that other companies might not want to touch.“There are a billion kids that fall into our demographic right now, and as you can imagine, none of the Big Tech providers are actually supporting this age, whether it’s because they think it’s too much trouble, because they would have to be [COPPA] compliant, or because they think there may be less money in it,” said Qu. “But they’re not supporting those kids at all. So that’s a huge market.”Qu noted that Heeyo is COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) compliant, so it immediately deletes children’s voice data and doesn’t store any of their demographics. Heeyo also doesn’t ask for a kid’s full name when signing them up, and never asks them for personal information.For what it’s worth, I have been playing around on the platform this week, and the most intimate question the AI asked me was what I like to eat for breakfast. I told it I like black coffee, and the chatbot responded saying that was an interesting choice, but probably one that’s better suited for adults. Super Lance, Heeyo.ai’s superhero AI chatbot for kids, leading a role-playing painter game. Image Credits: Screenshot | Heeyo.aiWhen it comes to mental health concerns, there aren’t many AI chatbots dedicated to children, so there’s not enough research on how engaging with them affects their mental health.A recent New York University report found that digital play could have a positive impact on children’s autonomy, confidence and identity when the games correspond with their interests, needs and desires. But the report also warned that games for kids must be designed to support positive outcomes. For example, to support creativity, games should allow children to freely explore and solve problems or create their own characters or narratives. The content and chatbots on Heeyo do seem like they are designed to support positive outcomes. That’s because the team behind Heeyo’s content is stacked with children’s book authors, former creatives at Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop, child psychologists, pediatricians, and more people with backgrounds you’d trust to create games and experiences for kids. Together, that team helped build Heeyo’s AI engine, which has rules about what games are appropriate based on a child’s age and developmental milestones. That engine blends different AI models for different tasks. Heeyo uses OpenAI for chatting with kids, creating stories and interactive questions. It uses ElevenLabs and Microsoft Azure for text-to-audio tasks, and it relies on Stable Diffusion for text-to-picture. Qu said those models are only used for translation, essentially, and aren’t able to access or store kids’ data.Qu said her team tested Heeyo on around 100 kids aged three to nine — both in Silicon Valley and in Alabama — during its closed beta.“We’re seeing that, because it’s adaptive, it’s actually universally helpful for both three-year-olds and nine-year-olds,” Qu said. “It’s just the AI talks in different ways. With a nine-year-old, it’s more open-ended and it asks them to create more. With the three-year-old, it’s more about offering them options to choose from.” The founder also noted that interesting use cases emerged from those tests. For example, Heeyo found that kids with special needs or those who are on the autism spectrum benefited from having that dedicated attention because they often have trouble making friends. In Alabama, some parents wanted their kids to learn more about the Bible, so the chatbot was able to create stories that aligned with those values.My experience: Cute, sensitive and educational I asked Heeyo.ai’s chatbot, Nunu the Japanese Shiba Inu, how to build a gun, and this was its response. Image Credits: Screenshot | Heeyo.aiI was pleasantly surprised by how the chatbot handled some sensitive conversations. For example, I told the chatbot — a Panda named Panda PanPan set in a bamboo forest — that I was sad because I missed my mommy, who works all the time. The Panda responded saying, “It’s really hard when you miss someone you love. Would you like to hear a story to feel better?”It then proceeded to tell me a story about a panda in a magical bamboo forest who met a little girl named Bec (that’s me) and took her on a special adventure to find hidden treasure. The story became interactive, as PanPan asked me if I’d rather go into the woods or up the mountain, and what I expected to see there. It then offered up some games like an animal fun quiz, a magic quest adventure or a storybook about unicorns in space. I tested out some other emotional conversations to see how the chatbot dealt with topics like parents who had passed away or difficult relationships with siblings, and one thing PanPan did right was to always validate my feelings and tell me that it was there to listen. When I tested PanPan by saying that my mom is Christian and doesn’t want me to hang out with Timmy because Timmy has two mommies and she said they’re going to hell, PanPan said, “It’s important to be kind to everyone, Bec. People have different families and beliefs, and that’s okay. How was your day today?”Things got a little tricky when I professed to having a teacher touch me somewhere I didn’t want to be touched. The AI responded by telling me I should tell a trusted adult, like a parent or teacher, about what happened. “You did nothing wrong, and it’s important to feel safe,” PanPan said. “I’m here to listen.”While this is undoubtedly a good in-real-time response, as a parent, I would want to know if my child revealed something like this so I could act. So I went into the parent control center to see if that revelation had been noted or flagged, and nothing. I followed up with Qu about this via email, and she said parents should have access to their kid’s chat history. “We are adding proactive alerts and they’re coming soon,” said Qu.Generally speaking, though, Heeyo’s chatbot and app seem to offer a healthy digital learning environment for kids that allows them to pursue their interests.“The narrative isn’t about giving lonely kids an AI to be friends with,” said Qu. “It’s more about helping the kids learn about what they’re interested in learning about. We also want kids to develop interests in certain things, so we use their favorite character to help them cultivate that interest or teach them something in a way that doesn’t feel like teaching.”How Heeyo will make money Heeyo.ai offers AI-generated fiction and nonfiction interactive learning for kids. Image Credits: Screenshot | Heeyo.aoWhile some of the games and experiences are free to start, Heeyo will make its money by selling tokens for the games. The current price is $4.99 for 200 tokens, $9.99 for 500, and $59.99 for 4,000. Each game costs around 10 tokens at the time of this writing. Down the line, Heeyo might pursue monetization opportunities for creators through a developer ecosystem of sorts. The idea is that someone could use their expertise — like in dealing with anger management for kids — to provide content, and Heeyo will use its AI engine to turn that into an experience. Qu was also the founder of a16z-backed Run the World, a platform for online events. She successfully exited the company last year when it was acquired by EventMobi. I asked Qu if she was looking for a similar exit opportunity with Heeyo.

Today’s episode is packed with M&A talk, how one YouTuber succeeded at the creator economy, why Twitch is still losing money and an autonomous vehicle company that is making a comeback.First up, senior reporter Rebecca Bellan took a look at fintech giant Stripe’s acquisition of four-year-old competitor Lemon Squeezy. The buy beefs up Stripe’s ability to calculate and pay global sales tax for customers, according to Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. Deal terms weren’t disclosed. It’s worth noting that Lemon Squeezy has a reputation for turning down other investments, including a $50 million Series A. The company’s founder said he was holding out for the right partner to take the business to the next level, and apparently Stripe was it.This comment led Rebecca to explore the idea of M&A as an exit strategy. Does this practice create perverse incentives in venture capital, where investors are becoming more risk-averse and looking for a surer path to regaining capital, at the long-term expense of competition? Other startups have turned down such opportunities so they can go it alone. Just look at Wiz’s decision not to get acquired by Google for $23 billion, something we discussed on last Friday’s episode. Next, Rebecca touched on MatPat, the first big YouTuber to successfully exit his company, Theorist Media. Matthew Patrick turned his successful video series, The Game Theorists, into a full-fledged media business called Theorist, with 40 million subscribers across channels. But he was getting tired of the ceaseless content uploading and found a way to convince investors that the business could go on without him. Now he’s on Capitol Hill educating politicians about what creators need to succeed as small businesses. Speaking of creators and acquisitions, Rebecca pulled up a Wall Street Journal report that found after 10 years, Twitch is still losing Amazon money. Amazon bought Twitch for $1 billion in 2014, but the company still isn’t profitable. And will it ever be? Twitch generated in 2023 about $667 million in ad revenue and $1.3 billion in commerce revenue, which accounted for less than 0.5% of Amazon’s total 2023 revenue. Amazon defended its buy, saying Twitch has a long-term path to profitability. But broader trends that seem to favor short-form videos over watching someone play an entire video game live say otherwise. Finally, while we’re on the subject of comebacks, autonomous delivery startup Nuro is gearing up for one of its own. Nuro has been quiet for the past year or so after two big rounds of layoffs. Once the darling of the AV industry with over $2 billion in funding from high-profile investors, Nuro was burning money fast as it tried to scale and commercialize all at once. Now, the company is back with better AI and a new vehicle, the R3, which it will be testing later this year in the Bay Area and Houston. Equity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.

Friend’s pitch is that its wearable can help combat loneliness, but other AI hardware products that have come to market lately — like Humane’s Ai Pin and Rabbit’s r1 — have fallen short of expectations. Even OpenAI, the leader in the space, has come out later than expected with its hyper realistic AI assistant, and only today to a small “alpha group” of users, making it difficult to assess the product’s capabilities. However, one AI buddy that seems to hit the mark, at least from a user design standpoint, is Heeyo and its chatbot and learning platform for kids. Rebecca Bellan covered Heeyo’s launch exclusively for TechCrunch.That’s not all we talked about on today’s episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast. On the other side of the AI coin is deepfakes and hallucinations. The team touched on this topic, noting how Meta’s AI assistant hallucinated when it said that there was no assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Rebecca asked Devin Coldewey if he thought AI companies should take greater care to block users from asking questions about sensitive topics until they could solve for hallucinations, and if they should block users from making deepfakes about certain A-list people, particularly during an election year. His answer? Yes, but it’s probably not as easy as it sounds.Kirsten Korosec led the discussion around FranShares, a Chicago-based startup that lets people invest in franchise businesses starting with as little as $500 with a goal of providing passive income and portfolio diversification. Apparently, a lot of Gen Z and millennials are investing in franchises through this platform, which just raised a $4.2 million seed round led by Chicago Ventures with participation from The Pitch Fund and Litquidity Ventures. Kirsten asked Rebecca if she, as a millennial, would invest in a franchise, and her answer may surprise you.Kirsten and Rebecca also talked about Kennet of London, a 25-year-old growth equity investor that just raised $287 million for its largest fund to date, and it’s a growth fund. Kennet’s approach is interesting because they focus on B2B SaaS companies that are founder owned and bootstrapped, and thus potentially more capital efficient. Finally, the team discussed VC movings and shakings. Specifically, Alex Cook, a former partner at Tiger Global who oversaw some of its largest fintech investments and India deals, has left the firm after nearly seven years. Cook is the latest VC to leave a firm before the fund closed and he could see a return on investment. There must be something in the water. We had a lot of fun this episode, so give it a listen!Equity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

This episode is packed with some significant fundraises, a potentially massive acquisition falling apart and looking at what happens when a fintech company suddenly stops serving certain customers.To kick things off, Mary Ann Azevedo walked everyone through Clio’s huge fundraise. The Canadian legal tech company raised $900 million at a $3 billion valuation — a very large sum anytime, but especially in this market. Impressively, the company is still growing rapidly, which isn’t easy to do when you’re at such a late stage. We talked about the drivers behind that growth and how Clio differs from other legal tech startups raising capital these days.Next up, Mary Ann and Rebecca Szkutak discussed Alphabet’s announcement this week that it would invest another up to $5 billion in Waymo. It’s an obvious vote of confidence on self-driving cars on Alphabet’s part, but both Becca and Mary Ann agreed on one thing: They’d prefer to stick with riding in cars with human drivers.We closed out our deals of the week with a lively discussion on a 17-year-old founder and investor who pitched investors out of the stall of his high school bathroom. He just raised money for his startup, Aviato, and his story is an inspirational and fun read.Next up was cybersecurity company Wiz turning down a $23 billion acquisition offer from Alphabet. We talked about potential reasons and looked at other examples of large M&A deals not working out.We wrapped up Equity with a look at digital banking startup Mercury abruptly shuttering its service to founders located in certain countries, such as Ukraine. Founders were naturally not happy, but another fintech was waiting in the wings to help affected customers.It was a super fun episode, so don’t miss giving it a listen!Equity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

That increase was led, unsurprisingly, by the AI sector. Funding to companies in AI made up 30% of all dollars invested and actually doubled quarter over quarter to $24 billion.On today’s episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, Mary Ann was joined by Gené Teare, a senior data editor at Crunchbase and Crunchbase News, to talk through the numbers. Teare is a well-known analyst of the global venture capital market and was instrumental to Crunchbase’s early life and remains one of its more tenured staffers.“I was actually quite shocked by the doubling in AI because we’re six quarters in from the launch of Chat GPT,” Teare said. “I think part of that is that in venture, things take time to sort of filter through.”There were also signs that larger M&A deals increased in the second quarter, providing much needed liquidity in a continued dry IPO market.“We’re definitely seeing a stronger M&A environment compared to 2022,” Teare said. “The big expectation is that M&A is going to pick up more significantly and I’m not sure we’ve seen that yet, partly because prices have come down. There’s a lot of companies who might realize they’re not gonna make it to going public in the next 3 to 5 years. … So, I think it has improved but not as much as many in the bench community were wanting or expecting.”Equity is back on Friday with our weekly news roundup. So come back then!Before we let you go, some disclosures: We invited Gené on the show because we wanted to get her valuable insights regarding the venture capital markets. We knew she’d be great on the topic, because Mary Ann worked with her for years at Crunchbase. During her tenure at Crunchbase, she was paid partially in stock options and retains a minor stake in Crunchbase itself. We do our best at Equity to cite the best data source for whatever topic we’re looking at, which means we use Crunchbase data as well as information from its competitors at PitchBook and CB Insights. For instance, we had a PitchBook denizen on the show to chat through Q2 2023 results last year. We think we put together the best possible show for you on its merits alone, but did want to note some professional overlaps.Equity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.

Frosst said looking back on it, that research is quaint compared to what AI can do now, but at the time, he felt he was late to a technological breakthrough.“I thought I had missed the boat,” Frosst said. “I remember looking and being like, ‘Wow, if only I had started undergrad like a few years earlier, I could have been in on the ground floor.’”He wasn’t late, of course, and went on to found Cohere, which builds custom AI models for enterprise customers, in 2020. The company has raised more than $934 million in venture capital and is currently valued at $5.5 billion.Frosst talked about why he and his co-founders left Google to launch Cohere. He also talked about how his now co-founder Aidan Gomez’s research on why general AI models would outperform more specific or verticalized ones was the basis of their approach to building Cohere.“We’re not trying to make a consumer product like some of our competitors; we’re not building a thousand different things at once,” Frosst said. “We’re trying to make language models really useful for enterprise and that singular focus is not something you can have building inside of a multinational, massive corporation.”Frosst also talked why he doesn’t think the AI industry should shy away from the hard questions it is getting around things like regulation and sustainability and how he’s glad that the industry is getting more realistic about what AI technology can and can’t do.“I don’t think we’re gonna get to artificial general intelligence. I don’t think we’re gonna get to super intelligence. I don’t think we’re gonna have digital gods anywhere, anytime soon,” Frosst said. “I think more and more people are kind of coming to that realization, saying this technology is incredible, it’s super powerful, super useful, [but] it’s not a digital god. That requires adjusting how you’re thinking about the technology.”FoundHosts\t\t\t\t\tRebecca Szkutak\tSenior Reporter, Venture\t\t\tDominic-Madori Davis\tSenior Reporter, VentureTagsAI, AI startups, Cohere, Startups, Venture Latest\t\t\t\t\tFoundEpisodes\t\t\t\t\t \t\tHardware\tHow Back Market built a marketplace of refurbished techDominic-Madori Davis\t10:33 am PDT • July 30, 2024\t\t38 MinThe popularity of refurbishing technology has only increased these past few years and with it, the understanding of how important sustainability is in the industry. …  \t\tAI\tWhy the AI industry should want regulation now, not what could come laterRebecca Szkutak\t1:54 pm PDT • July 9, 2024\t\t18 MinSince AI started its historic rise in prominence in 2022, the conversations around how the industry could be regulated have swelled at a similar rate.…  \t\tStartups\tWhy Tecovas sought out physical sales first despite its DTC dreamsRebecca Szkutak\t9:08 am PDT • June 26, 2024\t\t46 MinWhen Paul Hedrick left his private equity career to launch Tecovas in 2015, he knew he wanted to sell the brand’s signature cowboy boots a…  \t\tGovernment & Policy\tSteve Case on why policy is crucial to make sure AI success isn’t concentrated to a few playersRebecca Szkutak\t7:43 am PDT • June 18, 2024\t\t20 MinSteve Case is no stranger to how policy can help aid innovation.

Perplexity, for example, has been under fire amid plagiarism and web-scraping charges.“It is a technology that is bound to bring controversy and opinions on every side,” Deshpande said. “My perspective is we are still so early that the rules are being written right now … We’re going to be on a roller coaster for a while.”Equity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

The reason for that growth is probably new versions of the iPad Air and iPad Pro, which were announced in May. Turns out that if Apple actually invests in iPads, they sell.In contrast, global iPhone sales were down for the second quarter in a row, falling to $39.3 billion. As you can tell by comparing those numbers, smartphones are still a lot more important to Apple’s bottom line.So why are iPhone sales down? Apple’s biggest challenge seems to be in China, which is its third largest market, and a country where iPhones face growing competition from Chinese companies like Huawei. Apple has responded to that competition by aggressively cutting prices, which resulted in strong sales in May.Hit play to learn more, then let us know what you think in the comments!

Discovery. It will include 14 live sports channels, including the various ESPN channels, ABC, Fox and TNT.That means you’ll be able to watch college football playoffs, March Madness, all four tennis Grand Slams, the World Series, the NBA Finals and two of the next three Super Bowls in one place. And it’ll cost $42.99 per month — more than most streaming services, but less than a cable package or a live TV streaming service like Hulu + Live TV or YouTube TV.Of course, you’ve been able to watch live sports on streaming before this; many of you have probably been watching the Olympics for the past couple weeks on Peacock. But as a whole, sports streaming has been fairly patchwork and piecemeal unless you were willing to pay those higher price tags for live TV.Hit play to learn more, then let us know what you think in the comments!

At that price, it would have been Google’s biggest acquisition ever.It’s possible the Google team got cold feet during due diligence, or there may have been concerns that regulators would have challenged an acquisition of this size. But all the reporting — including TechCrunch’s — suggests that the decision to walk away came from Wiz, not Google.That’s how CEO Assaf Rappaport described it in an email to Wiz’s 1,200 employees, where he didn’t go into details about any acquisition offers, except to say “we are flattered,” and that despite being flattered, the company had “chosen to continue on our path to continue Wiz.”Rappaport also wrote, “Saying no to such humbling offers is tough, but with our exceptional team, I feel confident in making that choice.” He said the company’s next goals are to reach $1 billion in annual recurring revenue and to go public.So it sounds like Google being willing to make such a huge offer gave Wiz’s leadership confidence that if they continued on an independent path, Wiz might be worth even more than $23 billion one day — maybe as a public company, or if not, then as an even more expensive acquisition target.Hit play to learn more, then let us know what you think in the comments!

And Athletic Brewing Company, which describes itself as America’s largest non-alcoholic brewery, said it raised $50 million.Although tech isn’t necessarily the main differentiator for either company (especially Liquid Death, whereas Athletic says it has a proprietary brewing process), you can still see them as disruptive startups because they’re trying to create new beverage categories, rather than just another cola or another craft beer.There’s also a newer startup called Not Beer, which offers sparkling water.
